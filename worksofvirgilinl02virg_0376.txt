Tum vcro Aeneas, subitis exterritus umbris,

Conripit e somno corpus, sociosque fatigat t

Solvite vela citi. deus aethere missus ab alto,

Ecce iterum stimulat. sequimur te, sancte deorum,
Quisquis es, imperioque iterum paremus ovantes.

825. Seize, seize.] In the first book of Virgil, says the ju-
dicious Boss‘u, AEneas appears to be perfec'tly pious, and more
ready to ezrecute the will of the gods, than any other thing
whatever. In the fourth book a very difficult choice is pro·
posed to him; on one fide, gratitude‚ love, natural tender-
ness‚ and several weighty confiderations, engage him not to
part from Dido; on the other fide, an express order of the
gods commandshim to Italy. Before any one sees what fide he
will adhere to, and on what he will resolve, that which he has
already said and done, ought to have demonstrated what his will,
and what his inclinations are, and to what he will determine
his conduct. His former speeches which discover! to one his
future resolutioris are the poetical manners} these make one
foresee that he would leave Dido and obey the gods ; he does
so; the manners then are poetically good, and duly and justly
delineated. Chap. iv. Β. 4
