At tibi pro scelere, exclamat, pro talibus aulis, 535
Di, si qua cst caclo pietas, quae talia curet,

Persolvant grates dignas, et praemia reddant

Debita : qui gnati coram me cernere letum

Fecisti, et patrios foedasti funere voltus.

At non ille, satum quo te mentiris, Achilles 540
Talis in hoste fuit Priamo : sed jura fidemque

Supplicis erubuit, corpusque exsangue sepulcro

Reddidit Hectoreum, meque in mea regna remisit.

Sic fatus senior, telumque inbelle sine ic'tu

Conjecitt rauco quod protinus aere repulsum, 545
Et summo clipei nequidquam umbone pependit.

calls to our minds, all the noble aftions performed by Achilles
in the whole Iliad: and at the same time strikes us with the
utmost compaffion for this unhappy king, who is reduced so
low as to be obliged to kiss those hands that had ssain his sub-

730. The weapon languifhingly] The transsator has ex·
preffed the weakness of Priam’s effort by the flow of his verse ;
and by a happy alliteration that marks debility, and an inef-
fefitual attempt.

732. <Thou then be first] virgil was too judicious, says
Pope, to imitate Homer in some os his cruel aud inhumari
specches, made over the dying and the dead; andis much
more reserved in his sarcasms, and insults. There are not
above four or five in the whole AEneid. That of Pyrrhus to
Priam in the second book, though barbarous in itself, may be
accounted for, as intended to raise a charaeter of horror, and

render the aetion of Pyrrhus odi0u35 whereas Homer stains
