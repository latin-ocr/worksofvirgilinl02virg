Book ι. THE AEm-:m or VIRGIL. 117

Come to my palace then, my royal guest, 845
And, with your friends, indulge the genia] feast.
My wand'rings and my fate resembling yourS,
At length I settled on these Libyan stiores ;
And, touch’d with miseries myself have known,
I view, with Pity, woes so like my own. 850
She spoke‚ then leads him to her proud abodes,
Ordains a feast, and offerings to the gods.
Twice fifty bleating lambs and ewes she sends,
And twice ten brawny oxen to his friends :
A hundred bristly boars, and monstrous swine3 855
With Bacchus’ gifts‚ a store of generous wine.
The inner rooms in regal pomp display'd,
The splendid feasts in ample halls are made3
Where, labour’d o’er with art, rich carpets lie,
That glow refulgent with the purple dyc. 860
The boards are pis’d with plate of curious mould ;
And their forefathers’ deeds, in times of old, }
Blaz’d round the bonas, and charg'd the rifing gold.
No more the prince his eager love supprest,
All the fond parent strnggled in his breast. 865
He sends Achates to inform his son,
And guide the young Ascanius to the town ;

855. Abundred boars.] A feast suited to the fimplicity cf an-
c1ent times.

864. Eager lovan] Tenderness being the charaCteristic of
AEneas, the poet takes all opportunities of displayhig it.

866. ’ Hesends Achaten] The charaeter of Achates suggests to
us an observation we may often make, .on the intimacies of
great men, who frequently chuse their companions‚ rather for
the qualities of the heart than those of the her2d; and prefer
fidelity in an easy, inoffenfive, complying temper, to those
endowments which make a much greater figure among man·
kind. 1 do not remember that Achates, who is represented as
the first favourste, either gives his advice, or strikes a blow‚
thro’ the whole AEneid. Spectator, Nu 385.
