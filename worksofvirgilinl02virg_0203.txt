Book 2. THE AENEID OF Vnum.. '¹91‘

With many an ax by shouting swains is ply'd,
Fierce they repeat the strokes from every fide3
The tall tree trembling, as the blows go round,
Bows the high head, and nods to every wound ε
At last quite vanquish'd, with a dreadful peal, 840
In one loud groan rolls crashing down the vale,
Headlong with hals the shatter'd mountain flies‚
And stretch'd out huge in length th' unmeasur'd ruin lies.
Now, by the goddess led, I bend my way,
Tho' javelins hiss, and flames around me play; 845
With ssopping spires the flames obliquely fly,
The glancing darts turn innocently by.
Soon as, these various dangers past, I come
Within my rev’rend father’s ancient dorne,
VVhorn first I fought, to bear his helpless age 850
Safe o'er the mountains, far from hostile rage3
An exil'd life disdaining to enjoy,
He stands determin’d to expire with Troy :
F ly you, who health, and youth, and strength maintain,
Yon, whose warm blood-beats high {n every vein 3 855
For me had Heav'n decreed a longer date,
Heav'n had preserv'd for me the Dardan state3
Too much of life already have I known,
To see my country's fall prevent my own 3
Think then, this aged corse with Ilion fell, 860
And take, oh ! take your solemn last farewell:
For death—these hands that office yet can do5
If not—I'll beg it from the pitying foe.
At least the soldier for my spoils will come,
Nor heed I now the honours of a tomb. 865
Grown to my friends an useless heavy load,
Long have I liv’d, abhorr'd by every god,
Since, in his wrath, high Heaven’s almighty sire
Blasted these limbs with his avenging fire.
Thus he, and obstinately bent appears: 870
The mournful family stand round in tears.
