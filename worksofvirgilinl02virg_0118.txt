106 P. Vmoun MARONIS Annus. Lib. 1.

Hinc atque hinc glomerantur Oreades: illa pharetram
Fert humero, gradiensque deas supereminet omnis: 501
Latonae tacitum pertentant gaudia pastus.

Talis erat Dido: talem se laeta ferebat

Per medios, instans operi regnisque futuris.

Tum foribus divae, media testudine templi, 505
Septa armis, solioque alte subnixa resedit.

Jura dabat legesque viris : operumque laborem

Partibus aequabat justis, aut sorte trahebat:

Cum subito Aeneas concursu accedere magno

Anthea Sergestumque videt fortemque Cloanthum 510
Teucrorumque alios: ater quos aequore turbo
Dispulerat‚ penitusque alias avexerat oras.

Obstupuit fimul ipse, simul perculsus Achates
Laetitiaque metuque, avidi conjungere dextras
Ardebant 2 sed res animos incognita turbat. 515
Diffimulant3 et nube cava speculantur amidfi,

Qae fortuna viris; classem quo litore linquant3

Qid veniant. cunetis nam leeci navibus ibant,
orantes veniam, et templum clamore petebant.
Postquam introgressi, et coram data copia fandi3 520

O regma, novam quoi condere Juppiter urbem,
justitiaque dedit gentis frenare superbas;

Troes te miseri, ventis maria omnia veen,

(Odyss‘ey 108.) and that he even surpaffed his original. Vir-
gil has imitated the very same description in his AEneid2
What a pleasure might it have been to have compared the co-
pies of two such scholars as Apelles and Virgil, with the work
of so great a master as Homer? at least how much more plea-
fing, than to fall a disputing (as several of the critics have
done) whether Homer or Virgil have given the finest strokes on
this occaslon? This Diana both in the picture, and in the de-
scripdons, was the Diana Venatrix3 though she was not repre-
sented either by Virgil, or Apelles, or Homer, as hunting with
her nymphs3 but as employed with them in that sort of dances,
which of old were regarded as very solemn aas of devotion.”

A reader that is curious in such kind of criticisms, may find

in the ninth boot< of Gellius’s Noaes Atticae, that Υέῑεῖξιιε
