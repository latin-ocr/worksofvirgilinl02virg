The prince surveys the lofty tow’rs‚ and eries,
Blest, blest are you, whose walls already rise : 585
Then, strange to tell, he mingled with the erowds, ¹
And pass’d, unseen‚ involv’d in mantling clouds.

Amid the town, a stately grove display’d
A‘cooling shelter‚ and delightful shade.
Here, tost by winds and ψῆνες, the Tyrians found 590
A courser’s head within the sacred ground ;
An omen sent by Juno, to declare
A fruitful soil, and race renown'd in war.
A temple here Sidonian Dido rais’d
To heav'n’s dread empres3‚ that with riches blaz’d 3 595
Unnumber’d gifts adorn'd the costly ffirine,·
By her own presence hallow⁷d and divine.
Brass were the steps, the bearns with brass were strong,
The lofty doors, on brazen hinges, rung.
Here, a strange scene before his eyes appears, 603
To raise his courage‚¹ and dispel his fears 3
Here first, he hopes his fortunes to redress ε
And finds a glimmering prospe& of success.
While for the queen he wasted, and amaz'd,
O’er the proud shrine and pompous temple gaz’d 3 605
While he the town admires, and wond'ring stands
At the rich labours of the artists' hands ;
Amid the story’d walls, he saw appear,
In speaking paint, the tedious Trojan war3
The war, that farne had blaz'd the world around, 610
And every battle fought on Phrygian ground.
There Priam stood, and Agamemnon here,
And Peleus' wrathful son, to both severe.
