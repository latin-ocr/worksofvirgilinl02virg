For me mysriends forgetful left behind,
In the huge Cyclops' ample cave confin’d. 835
Floating with human gore, the dreadful dorne
Lies wide and waste, a solitary gloom!
With mangled limbs was all the pavement spread 3
High as the stars he heaves his horrid head.
The tow'ring giant stalks with matchless might3 840
