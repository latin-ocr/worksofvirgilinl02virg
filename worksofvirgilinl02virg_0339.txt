While there, exulting, to his utmost speed

The young Ascanius spurs his fiery steed,

Outstrips by turns the flying social talin, 235

And scorns the meaner triumphs of the plain τ

The hopes of glory all his soul inflame 3

Eager he longs to run at nobler garne,

And drench his youthsul javelin in the gore

Of the fiercc lion, or the mountain bour. 240
Meantime Xoud thunders rattle round the sky,

And hail and rain, in mingled tempest, fly3

While floods on floods, in swelling turbid tides,

Roll rom-ing down the mountain's channel'd fides.

To close retreats fied diverse o’er the plain.

To the same gloomy cave with speed repair

, With quivering flames the glimmering grotto mines: 250

With light’nings all the conscious skies are spread 3

Shame, eath, and ruin, and a length of woes.

Nor fame nor censure now the queen can move, 255

No more ihc labours to conceal her love.

Adorns the crime, and sanffifies t'ne ssxame.
