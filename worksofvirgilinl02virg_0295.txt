Now from her bellowing caverns burst away
Vast piles of melted rocks, in open day.
Her fflatter'd entrails wide the mountain throws,
And deep as hell her burning center glows.
On vast Enceladus this pond'rous load 78⁰
Was thrown in vengeance by the thund'ring god3
Who pants beneath the mountains‚ and expires,
Through openings hunge, the fierce tempestuous fires 5
Ost as he shifts his side, the caverns roar ; ’ζ
With smoke and flame the skies are cover'd o’er‚ 78 5
And all Trinacria shakes from {hore to shore. 3
. That night we heard the loud tremendous found,
The monstrous mingled peal that thunder'd round3
While in the shelt'ring vvood we fought repose,
Nor knew from whence the dreadful tumult rose. 790
For not one star displays his golden light3
The sszies lie cover’d in the ssmdes of night 3
The filver moon her glimmering splendor {hrouds
In gathering vapourS, and a night of clouds.

Now fied the dewy iliades of night away, 795
Before the blussies of the dawning day5

dering Trojans‚ sheltered in a wood, upon an unknown
coast, and hearing strange and terrible noises, during the
whole night, which was extremely dark and moonless, and
’ not knowing from whence these dreadful sounds came, or by
what they might be occafioned ε and at day-break being sud-
denly surprized at the ghastly figure of a man, who at first
runs towards them with great precipitation‚ seemingly to beg
some affistance, but suddenly stops and starts back at the sight
of Trojan arms and habits ; at last recovering himself a little,
resolves to fling himself into their hands, let what will be the
consequence: who, when they have received him into aves·
sel, gives them that dreadful narration of Polypheme, and in-
forms them that this was the Cyclops issand, and begs them
therefore to leave it instant1y‚ concluding most athetically,
that it would be some comfort to him, ifhe must ie, to perish
by the hands of men, and not of monstcrs.
