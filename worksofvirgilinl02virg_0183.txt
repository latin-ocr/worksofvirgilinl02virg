Book 2. THE AENEID of VIRGIL. 171

The like sad fate brave Hypanis amends,

And hapless Dymas‚ ssaughter’d by their friends.

Nor thee, fage pantheus ! Phoebus’ wreaths could save,
Nor all thy {hining virtues from the grave.

Ye dear, dear ruins ! and thou, Troy! declare 575
If once Ι trembled or declin’d the war:

Midst flames and foes a glorious death I fought,

And well deserv'd the death for which I fought.

The nce we retreat, our brave affociates gone,

Pelias and Iphitus v. ere le ft alone3 580
This ssow wi th age and bending to the ground,

And that more tardy from Ulyffes' wound.

Now from the palace-walls tumultuous ring

The shouts, and can us to defend the king 3

There we beheld the rage of fight, and there 585
The throne of death, and center of the war.

As Troy, all Troy befide had ssept in peace,

Nor stain’d by ssaughter‚ nor alarm’d by Greece.

Shield loek'd in finem, advance the Grecian pow'rs,

To burst the gates, and storrn the regal tow'r53 590
Fly up the steep ascent where danger calls,

And fix their scaling engines in the walls.

High in the left they grasp'd the fenceful finem,

Fierce in the right the rocky ramparts held ;

Roofs, tow'1·8‚ and battiements the Trojans throw, 595
A pile of ruins 1 on the Greeks below ;

Catch for defe nce the weapons of despair,

In these the dire extremes of death and wa r.

Now on their heads the pond' rous bearns are roll' d,

By Troy’ s first monarchs crusted round with gold. 600
Here thronging troops with glitt’ring faulchions stand,
To guard the portals, and the door command.

Strait to the palace, fir’d with hopes, I go

To aid the vanquissi’d, and repe! the foe?
