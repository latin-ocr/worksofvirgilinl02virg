Book 3. THE AENEm oF VlRGIL. ·

In one shall center both the kindred states,
The same their founder, and the same their fares !
And may their son to future times convey
The sacred friendship which we fign to-day.

We take to Italy the {hortest road,
By steep Ceraunian mountains, o'cr the flood.
Now the descending sun roll'd down the light,
The hills lie cover'd in the {hades of night3
*When some by lot attend, and ply the oars,

Some, worn with toil, lie stretch'd along the shores ;

And every breath explores that stirs the scas,

And watchful listens to the paffing breezc3

The watry Hyads, and the northern car,

In the blue vault his piercing eyes behold,

And huge Orion flame in arms of gold.

When all serene hc saw th’ etherial plain,

And wing with spreading sails the watry way.

Whose glowing blushes strcak the purple fizics z

And Italy, with {houts‚ the crowd replica.

Stands on the dcck, and calls tl1c'p0w’rs divine:
