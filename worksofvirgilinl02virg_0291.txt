Book 3. THE AENEID oF Vmcu„ · 279

Ye gods ἔ who fule-the tempests, earth, and scas, 715
Befriend our course, and breathe a prosperous breeze.
Up sprung th’ expeE'oed breeze 3 the port we⁴ spy, Ἰ

Near, and more near3 and Pallas' fane on high,
'With the steep hill, rose dancing to the eye. ς
Our sails are furl'd3 and from the seas profound‚ 720

VVe turn the prows to land, while Ocean fonnis around.
Where from the raging east the surges fiow,

The land indented bends an ample bow,

The port conceal’d within the winding shore,

Dassa’d on the fronting cliffs, the biliows· soar. 725
Two lofty tow'ring rocks extended wide,

With outstretch'd arms embrace the murmuring tide.

And cautious pass the hostile regions by.

Hence wc renown'd 'Tarentum’s hay behold,

Renown'd‚ 'tis said, from Hercules of old.

Oppos’d, Lacinia’s temple rose on high, 745
And proud Cauloniam tow'rs salute the sky.
