Book 2. THE AENEID OF V1RG1L.

Or sunk fatigu’d 3 or straggled from the train3

But ah ! she never blest these eyes again I
Nor, till to Ceres’ ancient wall we came,
Did I suspessst her lost, nor miss the dame„
There all the train assembled, all but ibe,

Lost to her friends, her father, son, and me.

What rnen, what gods did my wild fury spate ?

At both I ray’d, and madden'd with despair.
111 Troy's last ruins did I ever know

A scene so cruel 1 such transcendent woe!
Our gods, my son, and father to the train

Ι next commend, ‘and hide them in the plain3
Then fly for Troy, and ssiine in arms again. ,
Resolv’d the burning town to wander (fer,
And tempt the dengers that I scap’d before. μ
Now to the gate I run with furious haste,
VVhence first from Ilion to the plain I past :
Dart round my eyes in every place in vain,
And tread my former footsteps o’er again.
Surrounding horrore all my sou] affright3
And more, the dreadful silence of the night.
Next to my house I ssew without deiay,

If there, if haply there she bent her way.

In vainss-tlre conquering foes were enter'd there3
High9 o’er the dome, the flames emblizze the air3

Fierce to devour, the fiery tempest flies,
Swells in the wind, and thunders to the ss<ies.
“ Back to th’ embattlcd citadel I ran,

And search’d her father's regal walls in vain.
Ulysscs now and Phoenix I survey,

Who guard, in Juno’s fane, the gather'd prcy3
In one huge hcap the Trojan wealth was roll'd‚

Refulgent robes, and bowls of mass'y gold ;.

That repetition, expreffive of doubt and uncertainty, is very
elegant, says Trapp. 'Pitt has endeavoured to preserve this

beauty.
