Book 2. THE AENEm οι·- V1Ro1t. 185

In Vesta’s porch ; and by the dismal glare
Of rolling flames discern the fatal fair3
The common plague ! by Troy and Greece abhor'd 1
She fear’d alike the vengeful Trojan sword, 765}
Her injur’d country, and abandon’d lord.
Fast by the shrine I spy'd the lurking dame,
And all my soul was kindled into flame z
JMV ruin'd country to revenge‚ I stood
In vaist] resch Ἤ. to {hed her impious blood. 770
Shali sne, this guilty fair, return in peace,
A quoe-12„ tnumpham, through the realms of Greece,
And see„ aterne& 'oy 'ner Phrygian tram,
Her horne, her parents, sponse, and sons again ?
For her curi} muse shall raging flames destroy 775
The stately {ernestures of imperial Troy?
So many ssaughters drench the Dardan shore?
And Priam's self lie welt’ring in his gore ?
No 1—she shall die-for tho' the νὶᾶὶοι· gain
No fame, no triumph for a woman ssain3 780
Yet if by just revenge the traitress bleed,
The world consenting will applaud the deed :
To my own vengeance I devote her head,
And the great spirits of our heroes dead.

Thus while Ι rav’d‚ I saw my mother fise, ’ 785
Confess’d a goddess, to my wond'ring eyes,
In pomp unusual, and divinely bright3
Her beamy glories pierc’d the {hades of night ;
Such ss1e appear’d‚ as when in heav’n's abodes
She {hines in all her glories to the gods), 790
Just rais’d to strike, my hand she gently took,
Then from her rosy lips tne goddess spoke.

What wrath so fierce to vengeance drives thee on ἶ
Are we no obj· „irs of thy care, my son ?

ing to save the crty ! nothirag but the appearance of this god-
