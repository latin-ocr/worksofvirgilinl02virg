Book 1· Tmz AEm-:m οι·- VmeL. 119

(On his Ascanius turn his fear and joy,

The father’s cares are center'd in the boy ς)

To bring rich presents to the queen of Tyre‚ 870
And relies, rescu’d from the Trojan fise.

A manue wrought with saffron foliage round ς

And :2 stiff robe with golden figures crown'd 3

Fair Helen’s dress, when, fir'd with lawlessj0y‚

She left her native walls to ruin Troy, 875
(Her mother's present in the bridal hour 3)

With gold a shining sceptre studded o’er‚

That wont Ilione’s fair hand to grace,

The eldest nymph of Priam's beauteous race ς

Her necklaoe, strung with pearls3 her crown, that glows
Instarr'd with gems and gold in double rows. 881
To bring the splendid gifts without delay,

Swift to the fleet, Achates bends his way.

But beauteous Venus in her breast defign'd
New wiles, and plann’d new counsels in her mind, 885
That winged Cupid to the court should come
Like sweet Ascanius, in Ascanius' r00m3
With the rich gifts the Tyrian queen inspire,

And kindle in her veins the raging fire.

Her dread of Juno’s asts, who guards the place, 890
Her just suspicions of the treach'rous race,

Break‚ each revolving night, her golden rest:

And thus the suppliant queen the god addrest.

Oh son ! my strength ! supreme in heav’n above Ι
Whose arrows triumph o'er the bolt of Jove ε 895
To thee I fly, thy succour to implore,

Court thy prote&ion, and thy pow’r adore.
To tell how Juno’s restless rage has tost
Your brother round the seas, and cv'ry coast,

condescended to accompany him when he went a hundug, and
conducted him into the cave with Dido.'’ '
