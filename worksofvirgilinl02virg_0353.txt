Book 4. THE AEmzm or Vmcn.. v 34¹*

But soon the fraud unhappy Dido spies 3
(For what can 'scape a lover’s piercing eyes,
Who e'en in safety fears with wild affright ?)
She first discern’d the meditated Hight3
And Fame, infernal fiend, the news conveys, 430·
The {leet was rigg'd and launching on the scas.
Mad with despair, and all her foul on flamo,
Around the city raves the royal dame:
So the fierce Bacchanal with frantie eries,
Stung by the god, to proud Cithaeron flies, 435
And snakes her ivy spear and raves around,
While the huge mountain echoes to the found.
At length, by potent love and grief oppress’d‚
The queen, her recreant lover, first address’d:
And could’st thou hope, differnbler, from my sight, 440
Ah ἔ wretch perfidious ! to conceal thy ssight?
In such base silence from my realms to fail ?
Nor can our vows and plighted hands prevail,
Nor Dido's cruel death thy flight detain ?
For death, death only can relieve my pain: 445
And are thy vessels launch'd, while winter sweeps
With the rough northern blast the roaring deeps?
Barbarian ! say, if Troy herself had stood,
Nor foreign realms had call'd thee o’er the flood,
Would’st thou thy sails in stormy seas employ, 450
And brave the surge to gain thy native Troy ἓ
Me will you fly, to ternpt the dangerous wave?
Ah ! by the tearsI shed, the hand you gave3
(For these still mine, and only these remain 3
The tears I ffied, the hand you gave in vain l) 455
By those late solemn nuptial bands I plead,
By those first pleasures of the bridal bed ;
If e’er, when folded in your circling arms,
You figh’d, and prais’d these now-neglected charms ε
