Book 4. Tne AENmn or Vmou. -

For some small interval of time Ι move,
Some short, ssiort season to subdue my love3
Till reconcil’d to this unhappy state,
I grow at last familiar with my fate:
This favour if he grant, my death shall please
His cruel soul, and set us both at ease.
Thus pray'd the queen 3 the sister bears in vain
The moving message, and returns again.
He stands inflexible to pray'rs and tears,
For Jove and F ate had stopp'd the hero's ears.
As o'er th' aerial Alps sublimely spread,
Some aged oak uprears his reverend head 3
This way and that the furious tempests blow,
To lay the monarch of the mountains low 3
Th’ imperial plant, tho’ nodding at the found,
Tho' all his scatter'd honours strow the ground,
Safe in his strength, and seated on the rock,
In naked majesty defies the ssiock z
High as the head shoots tow'ring to the skies,
So deep the root in hell's foundation lies.
Thus is the prince befieg'd by constant pray'rs ε
But though his heart relents at Dido’s cares,
Still firm the di&ates of his soul remain,

And tears are shed, and vows preferr’d in vain.
Now tir’d with life abandon’d Dido grows 3
Now bent on fate, and harrass’d with her woes,

*She loathcs the day, she fickens at the sky,

And longs, in bitterness of soul, to die.

To urge the scheme of death already laid,

Full many a direful omen she survey'd :

While to the gods she pour’d the wrm, she view‘d
The pure libation turn'd to sable blood.

This horrid omen to herself revcal'd,

⁴ Ev’n from her listcr’s ears she kept conceal'd3
