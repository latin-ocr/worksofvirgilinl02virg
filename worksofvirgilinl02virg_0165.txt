Book 2. Tm: AEmzm or Vmcu„ '153

Lash’dro a foam the boiling billows roar,
And now the dreadful monsters reach'd the ffiore3 28 5
Their hiffing tongues they darted, as they came,
And their red eye—balls ihot a sanguIne fiame.
Pale at the sight, we fled in dire dismay 3
Strait to Laocoon they dire& their way 3
And first in curling fiery volumes bound ²90
His two young sons, and wrapt them round and round,
Devour’d the children in the father's view 3
Then on the miserable father ssew,
While to their aid he runs with fruitlessrhaste3
And all the man in horrid folds embrac'd ; 295
Twice round his waist, and round his neck they rear
Their winding heads, and hiss aloft in air.
His sacred wreaths the livid poisons stain,
And, while he labours at the knots in vain,
Stung to the soul, he bellows with the pain. 300
So, when the ax has glanc'd upon his skull,
Breaks from the shrine, and roars the wounded bull.
But each huge serpent now retires again,
And flies for shelter to Minerva's fane 3
Her buckler's orb the goddess wide display’d, 305
And screen'd her monsters in the dreadful ffiade.

Then, a new fear the trembling crowd possest,
A holy· horror pants in every breast ;
All judge Laocoon justly doom'd to bleed,
W'nose guilty spear profan’d the sacred steed. 310
We vote to lead him to Minerva's tow'r,
And supplicate, with vows, th' offended pow’r:

298. Sacred wreaths] It heightens the pathetie to say vittas
*and not only tempora: as it also does to represent Laocoon

sii'zliid by the serpents while he was endeavouring to affist his
c ι ren.
