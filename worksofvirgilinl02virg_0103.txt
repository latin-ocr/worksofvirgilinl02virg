Book 1. THE AEm-:m or Virmn.. 91

Ho ! gentle youths, 'she cry’d, have you beheld 430
One of my fisters wand'ring o'er the field,
Girt with a speckled lynx's vary'd hide,
A painted quiver rattling at her fide?
Or have you seen her with an eager pace
Urge with full eries the foarning boar in chace ? 435
None of your charming fisterhood (he said)
Have we beheld, or heard, oh ! beauteous maid.
Your name, oh ἔ nymph, or oh Ι fair goddess, say?
A goddess, sure, or fister of the day,
You draw your birth from some immortal line, . 440
Your looks are heav’nly‚ and your voice divine,
Tell me, on what new climate are We thrown?
Alike the natives and the lands unknown 3
By the wild waves, and swelling surges tost,
We wander strangers on a foreign coast. 445
Then will we still invoke your sacred name,
And with fat vidffims {hall your altars flame.
No goddess' aweful name, {he said, I bear3
For know, the Tyrian maids, by custom, here }
The purple busszin, and a quiver wear. 450
Your eyes behold Agenor's walls aspire 3
The Punic realms5 a colony from Tyre.
See ! wide around, waste Libya's bounds appear,
Whose swarthy sons are terrible in war.
From her fierce brother’s vengeance, o’er the main, 455
From Tyre, fled Dido, and enjoys the reign:
The tale is intricate, perplex'd and long 3
Hear then, in short, the story of her wrong.
Sichaeus was her lord, beyond the rest
Of the Phoenieian race, with richcs blest3 460
Much lov’d by Dido, whom her father led
Pure, and a virgin, to his nuptial bed.
Her brother, fierce Pygmalion, fill’d the throne
Of Tyre, in vice unrivall'd and alone.
