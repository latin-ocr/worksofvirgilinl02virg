18 DISSERTATION.

that it is wonderful so many critics should have mistaken
it, especially those of France ε

'Stultorum regum ξεῖ populorum continet cestus.

I have purposely avoided entering into any minute com-
pat'ison betwixt these two great poets‚ because all that
can justly be said on the subject is comprehended in the
following excellent words of Pope:

“ No author or man, ever excelled all the world, in
more than one faculty, and as Homer has done this in
invention, Virgil has in jxudgment. Not that we are to
think Homer wanted judgment because Virgil had it in
a more eminent degree ; or that Virgil wanted invention
because Homer poss'effed a larger {hare of it: each of these
great authors had more of both than perhaps any man
befides, and are only said to have less in comparison with
one another. Homer was the greater genius, virgil the
better artist. In one we most admirc the man, in the
other the work.'’

If it be allowable to criticise in the way of image-ry,
I would add to these words of Pope, that the muse of
Homer, full of fise and enthusiasm, resembles the Sybil
in her prophetie fury;

.N012 comptae mansere comae3 scd pestus anhelum,
Et rabie scra corda tamenn majorque videri,

Nec mortale scnans.—--——

But the muse of Virgil, more-grateful and sedate, ma}r
be compared to the elegant figure he himself has painted
of the mother of his hero3

Et vera incqffu patuit dea.
