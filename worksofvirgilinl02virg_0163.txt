-Book 2. ΤΗΒ AENMD or Vmorx..

But Calchas order’d this enormous fizc,
This monstrous bulk, that heaves into the fides,

151

Lest Troy should lead it through her opening gato, 250

And by this new palladium guard her state.
For 011 I γε Phrygiam, had your rago profan’d
This gift of Pallas with an impious hand,
Some fate (which all ye pow'rs imrnortal {hed
Vsith all your vengeance on its author’s head 1)
In one prodigious ruin would destroy

Thy empirc, Priam, and the sons of Troy.
But would you join within your walls to lead
This pledge of heav'n, this tutelary steed 3
Then, with her hosts, all Afia ssraH repair,
And pour on Pelops' walls a storm of war3
Thon Greece shall bleed, and peril'h in her turn3
Her future sons 3 her nations yet unborn.

Thus did the‘pcrjur’d Sinon’s art prevail 3
Too fondly we believ’d the study'd tale 3
An'd thus was Troy, who bravely could sustain
Achilles' fury, when he swept the plain,

A thousand vcffels, and a ten years war,
Vson 'oy‘a figh, and vanquish’d by a tear.

Here a more dreadful obje& rose to fight,
And {hook our sauls with horror and affright.
Unblest Laocoon, whom the 1015 dessgn
Priest of the year, at Neptune’s holy sanne
Slew on the szmds, befide the rolling flood,

A statc}y stecr, in honour of the god.

When, horrid to relate 1 two serpents glide
And roll incumbent on the glassy tide, .
Advancing to the [hore 3 their spires they mise
Fold above fold, in many a tow’ring maze.
Beneath their burnish’d brcasts the waters glow,
Their crimson crests inflame the dceps below5
O’cr the vast flood extended long and wide,
Their curling backs lay floating on the tide3
