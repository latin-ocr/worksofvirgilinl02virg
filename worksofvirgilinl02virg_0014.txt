(peak, and in the other the poet himself makes the narra·
tion ε a circumstance, which inclines Aristotle to give the
preference to dramatic even :ibove epic poetry3 as a more
natural and forcible species of imitation.

One may define epic poctry to be, a fable related in
verse, to inspire an admiration and love of virtue, in re-
presenting to us the action of an hero, favoured and
affisted by Heaven, who executes some grand dcsxgn, not-
