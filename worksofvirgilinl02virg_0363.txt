Book 4. THE AEm-:m or Vmcrr.. 35¹

To what submiffions, of what low degree,
Are mortals urg'd, imperious Iove, by thee ?
Once more (he flies to pray'rs and tears, to move
Th³ obdurate prince 3 and anger melts to love 5 600
Tries all her suppliant female arts again
Before her death 3-but tries 'em all in vain z
Sister, behold, from every fide they pour
With eager speed, and gather to the shore.
Har-k-how with shouts they catch the springing gales‚ 605
And crown their ships, and spread their flying sails.
Ah ἒ had I once foreseen the fatal blow,
Sure, I had borne this mighty weight of woe-
Yet, yet, my Anna, this one trial make
For thy despairing, dying fister's sake. 610
For ah ἔ the dear perfidious wretch, I see,
Lays open all his secret soul to thee.
In all his thoughts you ever bore a part,
You know the nearest passage to his heart.
Go then, dear sister, as a suppliant go, 615
Tell, in the humblest terms, my haughty foe,
I ne'er conspir’d at Aulis to destr0y‚
With vengeful Greeee, the hapless sace of Troy;
Not sent one veffel to the Phrygian coast,
Nor rak’d abroad his father’s sacred dust. 620
From all the pray'rs a dying queen prefers,
Why will he turn his unrelenting ears ἒ
Whither‚ ah Whither‚ wil] the tyrant fly ?
I beg but this one grace before Ι die,
To wait for calmer seas and foster gales 625
To smooth the floods, and fill his opening falls.
Tesl my perfidious lover, Ι implore
The name of wedlock he disclaims no more:
No more his purpos’d voyage I detain
‚ From beauteous Latium, and his destin’d reign. 630
