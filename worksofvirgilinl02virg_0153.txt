Then, had not partial Fate conspir'd to blind,
· With more than madness‚ ev’ry Trojan mind, ⁸
The crowd the treach'rous ambush had explor'd‚
’ And not a Greek had 'scap’d the vengeful sword; 75
Old Priam still his empire would enjoy,
And still thy tow’rs had stood, majestic Troy!
Mean time, before the king, the Dardan swains,
With shouts triumphant, brought a youth in chains,
A willing captive to the Trojan hands, 80

The fate and tidings of a captive foe.

And laid his well-diffembled fears afide.
All, all, with truth‚ great monarch, Iconfess‚ ιο.
And first I own my birth deriv’d from Greece ς
Wretch as he is, yet Sinon can defy
The frowns of fortune, and disdains a lye.
You know, perchance, great Palamedes’ name,
Thro’ many a distant realrn renown’d by fame3 105
Condemn’d‚ tho’ guffiless, when he mov’d for peace,
Condemn'd for treason by the voice of Greece,
