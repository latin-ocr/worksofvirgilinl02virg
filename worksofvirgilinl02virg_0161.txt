Book 2. Tm: AEmzm oF Vmou„ 149

Renounce my country, hate her sons, and lay

Their inmost counsels open to the day.

And thou, O Troy, by Sinon snatch'd from fate,

Spare, spare the wretch‚ who saves the Phrygian state.
Greece on Minerva’s aid rely'd alone, 216
Since first the labours of the war begun-

But from that execrable point of time,

When Ithacus, the first in ev’ry crime,

With Tideus’ impious son, the guards had ssain, 220
And brought her image from the Phrygian fane,
Distain’d her sacred wreaths with murderous hands,

Still red and reeking from the ssaughter'd bands ;

Then ceas'd the triumphs of the Grecian train,

And their full tide of conquest sunk again ς 225
Their strength deoey’d, and many a dreadful fign

To trembling Greece proclaim'd the wrath divine.
Scarce to the camp the sacred image came,

When from her eyes [he flaih’d a living flame ς

Α briny sweat bedew'd her limbs around, 230
And thrice she sprung indignant from the ground5
Thrice was {he seen with martial rage to wield

Her pond’rous spear, and shake her blazing ffiield.

With that, fage Calchas mov’d the trembling train

To fly, and measure back the deeps again3 235
That 'twas not giv’n our armies to destroy

The Phrygian empire, and the tow'rs of Troy,

Till they should bring from Greece those favouring gods,
Who smil'd indulgent, when they plough'd the floods ;
With more auspicious signs rcpass the main, 240
And with new omens take the field again.

Now to their native country they repair,

With gather’d forces to renew the war ;

The scheme of Calchas l but their vanish’d host

Will soon return to waste the Phrygiam coast. 245
Ali Greece, atoning dire Ulyffesf deed,

To Pallas’ honour rais'd this wond'rous steed3
