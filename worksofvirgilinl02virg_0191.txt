Book 25 ‘THE AEumn 01³ Vmon„ 179

In arms, long fince disus'd‚ the hoary fage 680
Loads each stiff languid limb, that {hook with age3
Girds on an unperforming sword in vain,

And runs on death amidst the hostile train.

Within the courts, beneath the naked sky,

An altar rose3 an aged laurel by 3 685
That o'er the hearth and houshold-gods display'd

A solemn gloom, a deep majestic ssiade:

Hither, like doves, who close-embody'd fly

From some dark tempest blaek’ning in the sky,

The queen for refuge with her daughters ran,- 690
Clung and embrac'd their images in vain.

But when in cumbrous arms the king {he spy'd,

Alas ! my poor unhappy lord Ι ssie cry'd,

What more than madness, ’midst these dire alarms,
Mov’d thee to load thy helpless age with arms ? 695
No aid like thine this dreadful hour demands,

But asks far other strength, fas· other hands.

No l could myv own dear Hefflr arm again,

My own dear Hes’tor now would arm in vaina

Come to these altars; here we all snall have 700
One common refuge, or one common grave.

This said, her aged lord the queen embrzoe’d,

And on the sacred seat the monarch plac’d.

When lo Ι Polites, one of Priam's sons, 704
Through darts and foes, ficm ssaught'ring Pyrrhus runs,
³ Wounded he traverses the cloyster⁷d dome,

Darts through the courts, and ssioots from room to room:

Close, close behind, pursu'd the furious foe,

Just grasp’d the youth, and aim’d the fatal blow;

'Soon as within his parents sight he'past‚ 710

Pierc'd by the pointed death, he breath'd his last:

He fell; a purple stream the pavement dy’d,

The soul comes gussiing in the crimson tide.

The king, thatscene impatient to survey,

Tho’ death surrounds him, gives his fury wriy3 715
