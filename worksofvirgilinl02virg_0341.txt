Book 4. Tm: AEnmn oF V1Ro11„ 329

Now Fame, tremendous fiend ! without delay
Through Libyan cities took her rapid way. 260
Fame, the swift plague, that every moment grows,

And gains new strength and vigour as {he goes.

First small with fear, she swells to wond’rous fize,

And stalks on earth, and tow'rs above the sstie83

VVhom, in her wrath to heav’n, the teeming earth 265
Produc’d the last of her gigantic birth;

A monster huge‚ and dreadful to the eye,

'With rapid feet to run, or wings to fly.

Beneath her plumes the various fury bears

A thousand picrcing eyes and list’ning ears ς 270}

And with a thousand mouths and babbling tongues ap-
pears.

Thund’ring by night, through heaven and earth she flies3
No golden ssumbers seal her watchful eyes;

On tow’rs of battlement she sits by day,

And ffiakes whole towns with terror and dismay ; 275
Alarms the world around, and, perch'd on high,
Reports a truth, or publiihes a lye.

259. Now Fame, tremendousfiendl] The description of this
allegorical person of Fame is undoubtedly beautiful, but per·
haps is rather too long. Addison is of opinion that these shadowy
figures should have no share in the astion of an epic poem,
and on these principles seems to condemn the fine allegory of
Sin and Death in Milton.

This sublime image,
And staiks on earth, and tow’rs above the ficies,

is literally copied from Homer-‘s noble description of Discord,
which Longinus so greatly admires, Sea. ix. saying the space
between heaven and earth marks out the vast reach and capa-
city of Homer's ideas, Iliad. iv. ver. 443. There is a thought
of equal sublimity in the Wisdom of Solomon: “ Thy almighty
word leaped down; it touched the heaven, but it stood upon

the earth.'' C. xviii. ver. ις, 16.
