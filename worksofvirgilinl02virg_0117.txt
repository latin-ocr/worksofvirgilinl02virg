And fix’d her eyes, relentless on the ground. 650
Achilles here, his vengeance to enjoy,'
Thrice dragg'd brave He<9mr round the walls of Troy}
Then to the mournful sire, the νίἑὶοι· sold
The breathless body of his son for gold.
His groans now deepen’d‚ and new tears he shed, 655
To see the spoils and chariot of the dead,
And Priam both his trembling hands extend,
And, gash’d with wounds, his dear disfigur'd friend.
‘ Mix'd with the Grecian peers, and hostile trahi,
Himself he view’d, conspicuous in the plain : 660.
And swarthy Memnon, gloriou's to behold,

Amidst the thousands stood the dire almns,
And the fierce maid engag'd the men in arms.

(pulcherrima Dido) like a masterly painter‚ with one stroke of
his pencil, gives one a fuller idea of her beauty‚ than all the
florid expressions which Taffo has bestowed on his Armida.
See the fixteenth book of Godfrey of Bullozgn.

673. As on Eurotas‘ bank-n] ‘⁸ The height of Diana’s stature
is frequently marked out by the pects-5 and that generally by
