The ARGUMENT.

AEneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the ·
fleet in which he sailed, and the succeſs af hisfirst voyage to
Thrace t from thence he dir-eas his course to Delos, and
asks the oracle what place the gods had appointed for his ha-
bitation ? By α mistake of the oracle's answer, he settles in
Crete3 his houshold gods give him the true sense of the ora-
cle in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the
best qf his way for Italy : he is cest on several shores, and
meets with very surprizing adventures, till at length he
lands on Sicily; where his father Anchises dies. Ybis
is the place which he was sailing from, when the tempest
rose, and threw him upon the Carthaginian ceast.
