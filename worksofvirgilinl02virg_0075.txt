Book‘x. THE AEmsm OF Vmcn„ -63

With all these mot-{ves fir'd, from Latium far 40
She drove the relies of the Grecian war :
Fate urg'd their course; and long they wander’d o’er
The spacious ocean tost from lhore to shore.
So vast thc- work to build the mighty frame,
And saise the glories of the Rornan name Ι 45
Scarce from Sicilian {hores the {houting train
Spread their broad sails, and plough'd the foamy main3
When haughty Juno thus her fage exprest 3
Th’ eterna] wound still rankling in her breast.
Then must I stop ? are all rny labours vain ? 50
And must thiS Trojan prince in Latium relgn ?

reser ’.ε Homer, who was {o highly admired by Horace,
scarce does any thmg without them3 and V irgil, who .an both
admired and loved so much byl rim (and whose AEne d wa s even
published ten years before Horace died) follows Home· more
closely 1n this, than in any other point Ι know of. Eut the
example of virgil is, Ι think, sufficient for me at present3
who has employed maehinery so much and so fseely in his
AEneid, that almost the whole of the story is carried on by the
intervention of the gods. lf we just [ωτι-νειμ the first book in
this light, we {hail see, thar. if .AEneas msc-*ts raith a storm, just
after his first setting out, it is AEclus [lut mise& ι. at the request
of Jun0‚ and by the operation of the several gen1us²s that
prefide over the winds: if the lea grows calm again, it is by
the appearance of the deity who prelides over that element;
who countermands thole wlnds and semis them back to their
caves. If AEneas lands on the coast of Africa, and is to he
kindly received at Car‘thage, it is lecfcury that is sent by ju,
piter to soften the minda of the Carthaginians and their queen
toward him. And if he escapes all the attacks and dangers in
paffing through an unknown country, and an inhospitable peo-
ple, till he comes to then· capital; {t is Venus w=zoihr01.=.ds him
m a cloud, and proteEts him from :11 danger. In fine if the
queen falls' m love wn h him when he ις ars ·ved the xe; though
she be represented as not old, and he as very h md1 ome: yet
must Cupid do no less, than u. d rgo a t1ansfor1naz³015 tolie
on her breast and msxnur te hat sos: pais xon tuere.

“ 'Ihis sort of managemert uhi h ιε used so much by Vir-
gil in the entrance of his poem, ru ιε through it qu> re to the

the last book, as it did ln his arr· val at Carthago Ξῑι the first.
