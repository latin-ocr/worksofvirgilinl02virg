Book 4. Tm: AENEn) OF VIRGIL.

At length distrae’ted‚ and by love o’ercome‚
Resolv'd on death, she meditates her doom;
Appoints the time to end ‘her mighty woe,

And takes due mensures for the purpos’d blow.
Then her sad fister she with smiles address’d,
Hope in her looks, but anguish at her breast :

Anna, partake my joy, for 10 ! I find
The sole expedient that can cure my mind,
Relieve my foul for ever from her pain,

Or bring my lover to my arms again.

Near Ocean’s utmost bound, a region lies, ,
Where mighty Atlas props the starry skies 3
There lives a priestess of Massyliam strain,
The guardian of the rich Hesperian fane ;
who wont the wal-:eful dragon once to seed
With honey'd cakes, and poppy's drowsy seed,
That round the tree his fhining volumes roll'd
To guard the sacred balls of blooming gold.
By magic charms the matron cau remove,

Or fiercely kindle all the fires of love;

Roll back the stars 3 stop rivers as they flow;
And call grim speehcs from the rcalms of woe.
Trees leave their mountains at hor potent call;
Beneath her footsteps groans the trembling ban :
But witness thou, and all ye gods on high,
With what regret to magic rites I fly-

Go then, ere& with specd and secret carc,
Within the court, a pile in open air.

Bring all the traitor’s arms and robe-5, and spread
Above the heap our fatal bridal bed.

The sacred dame commands me to destroy

All, all memorial> of that wretch from Troy.

Thus with diss'embling asts the princess spoke .·
A deadly paleness spreads o'er al} hm· look.
Nor could her wretched fister oum* divine
These rites could co» er such a dire ,ἰςέῐῦνιῃ
