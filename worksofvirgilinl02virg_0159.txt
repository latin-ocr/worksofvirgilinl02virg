Book 2. THE AENEID OF Vmon.. 147

I fied th' appointed ssaughter, I confess,
And, till our troops should hoist their sails for Greece,
Swift to a ssimy lake I took my ssight,
Lay wrapt in flags, and cover’d by the night.
And now these eyes shall view my native shore, 180
My dear, dear children, and my fise no more ;
Whom haply Greece to ssaughter has decreed,
And for my fatal ssight condemn'd to bleed.
But thee, O gracious monarch, I implore
By ev'ry god, by ev'ry sacred pow'r, 185
Who conscious of the fa&s my lips relate,
With truth inspire me to declaret my fate 3
By all the solemn sanffions that can bind
In holy ties the saith of human kind ;
Have mercy, mercy, on a guiltless foe, 190
O'erwhelm'd and sunl< with such a weight of woe l
His life we gave him, and dispell'd his fears,
Touch'd with his moving eloquence of tear53
And, melting first, the good old king commands,
To free the captive, and to loose his hands. 195
Then with soft accents‚ and a pleasing look,

v Mild and benevolent the monarch spoke.

Henceforth let Greece no more thy thoughts employ,
But live a subjetss'c and a son of Troy3
With truth and stri& sincerity proceed‚ 200
Say, to what end they fram’d this monstrous steed;
Who was its author, what his aim, declare3
Soms solemn vow ? οι· engine of the war?

Skill’d in the frauds of Grcece, the captive scats
His hands unlhackled to the golden stars; 205
Yon, ye eternal splendors l he exclaims,
And you divine inviolable flames,
Ye fatal swords and altars, which I fled,⁴
Ye wreaths that circlcd this devoted head 3
All, all, attest ,Ι that justly I release 210
My sworn allegiance to the laws of (hecco,
