VIRGIL’S AENEID.

THE

THIRD. BOOK.

H E N Heav'n destroy’d‚ by too severe a fate,
The throne of Priam, and the Phrygiam state,
When Troy, tho' Neptune rais’d her bulwarks round,
The pride of Asta, smok’d upon the grou ad,
We fought in vacant regions new abodes, 5
Call'd by the guiding'omens of the gods.
Secret, a sudden navy we provide,

Beneath Antandros, and the hius of Ide.

owing to the disadvantage of lts fituation as to an) other reason· 3
for the 1econd book, whic h immediate1y precedes 1;,cont2ining
the destruffion. and burning of ι roy, Ριείεηῑε so great an obje εἰ
to the reader‚ that he ἀίἐάᾶίηε the third: and the fourth is so
charming and mterer'ting 'oy the tende rneis and past} on which
it contains, that one has naturally an impatienee to read it.
Thus, as it is enough to know, that after the taking of Tro), .
AEneas arrived at Carthage3 this third book 15 of cen pass'ed ovet⁸
intirely‚ or if the readers runs over its argument and contents
cursorily‚ :et he disdains to study 1t so at tentively as the others· ,
nevertheless, it is in this book (next to the fixth) that there ιε
more to be· earnt than m the whole AEmzid, as well from this
ancient geographica} chart, which is very exafil, as from the
different picturas of civil life, and from those fine monuments
of the ancrent reli gious customs, which ar: not to be found else-
where What therefore appel« ns to 'oe adnm· 2‘1b1e m this great
work, is ‚that every thing m ιε is beautiful, but nothing alike.
