But it is not sufficient for an cpic poem to be filled with
such thoughts as are natural, unless it abound also with
such as are sublime. Virgil in this particulai is thought
to fall ffiort of Homer. He has not indeed so many
thoughts that are what. we now call low and vulgar, but
at the same time' he has not so many thoughts that ai e
exalted and sublime. The truth of it is, Virgil seldom
rifcs into very astonissiing sentiments‚ where he is not
fired by the Iliad. He every where chari-ns and pleases us
by the force of his own genius ; but seldom elevates and
transports us where he does not borrow his hints from
Homer.

Though this remark is doubtless true in gencrai‚ yet I
believe many instanees of great sublimity may be pro-
duced‚ for which our poet has not been totail y indebted
to his Greek master.
