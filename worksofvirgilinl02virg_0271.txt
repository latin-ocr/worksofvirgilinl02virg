,So strange a fight astoniih’d to survey‚ 410
The princess trembles, falls, and saints away.
Her beauteous frame the vital warmth fo'rsook,
And, scarce recover'd, thus at length she spoke:
Ha l-is it true ?—-in person ? and alive?
Still‚ dost· thou still, oh! goddess—born, survive? 415
Or, if no more thou breathe the vital air,
Where is my iord, my Hecssor, tell me where?
Then‚ the big sorrow streamin'g from her eyes,
She fill'd the air with agonizing eries, Δ
Few words to soothe her raging grief I say,- 420
And scarce those few, for sob's, could find their way.
Ah l trust your eyes, no phantoms here impofe 5
I live indeed, but drag a life of woes.
Say then, oh say, has fortune yet been just
To worth like yours, fince Hestor sunk in dust? 425
Or oh ! is that great hero's confort led
(His dear Andromache) to Pyrrhus' bed ?
To this, with lowly voice, the fair replies,
While on the ground she fixt her streaming eyes ε
Thrice blest Polyxena ἔ ccndemn’d to fall 430
By vengeful Greece beneath the Trojan wall ;
Stabb’d at Pelides’ tomb the vie‘tim bled,
-To death deliver'd from the vietor’s bed.
Nor lots disgrac’d her with a chain, like me,
A wretched captive, drag’d from sea to sea! 435
Doom'd to that hero's haughty heir, I gave
A son to Pyrrhus, more than half a ssave.
From me, to fair Hermione he ssed
Of Leda's tace, and fought a Spartan bed 3

sacking of Troy, Achilles’s ghost appeared, and demanded
that Polyxena should be sacrificed to him: ihc was accordingly
ssain upon his tomb by Pyrrhus the son of Achilles. Tne
Hecuba of Euripides is founded on this subje&; and the de-

scription of Polyxena's manner of dying, related by the herald .

Talthybius in the third aet, is very noble.
