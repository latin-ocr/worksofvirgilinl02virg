DISSERTATION. ¹}-

dcsty, and* reservedness of the lovely Lavinia3 are all of
them painted in the most lively and natural colours‚ are
strongly contrasted to one another, and are just draughts

of characters in our poet as in Homer, yet perhaps it
may be urged in his dcfence, that by this very circum-
