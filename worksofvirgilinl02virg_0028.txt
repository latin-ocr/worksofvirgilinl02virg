16 DISSERTATION.

passages, Sophocles, were guilty of this sault; among
the Latius, Lucan, Statius, claudian and Seneca3 among
the English, Shakespear, and the pathetic Lee 3 among the
French, Du Bartas, Ronsard, and even sometimes Cor-
neille. In these authors, the affe&ati0n of greatness often
hurts the perspicuity of style3 as in many others the en-
deavour after perspicuity prejudices its greatness. virgil
has kept a just mean, is clear without being tame, and is
losty without being turgid in his expreffions.

In Virgil we meet with no mixture of different ideas,¹
no metaphors harsh and violent, no epithets that clalh

Virgil’s numbers, as in most other Latin writers, parti-
cularly Ovid and Claudian : his pauses in. each line are per-
petually varied3 his periods fill and satisfy the car; t'ne eli-
fions with which he generally closes his periods, are intro-
duced with as good effee‘t as the flats and sharps in music3
and above all, there is a certain majesty in his lines that
approaches as near Homer’s verfification as the patrii str-
mcm's egestas would allow.

As to those verses in virgil, which are an echo to the
sense, and which express by their found and flowing, the
thing described, there is no doubt to be entertained, but
that the poet frequently intended this beauty‚ though per-
