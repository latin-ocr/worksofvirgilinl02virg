Book 2. Tne AENEID OF mex.. ¹75

Fun in the portal rag'd with Ioud alai-ms
Brave Pyrrhus, glitt’ring in his brazen arms.
So from his den, the winter ssept away, 625
Shoots forth the burniih'd snake in open day3
who, fed with cv'ry poison of the plain,
Sheds his old spoils, and {hines in youth again3
Proud of his golden scales rolls tow’ring on, »
And darts his forky sting, and glitters on the sun. 630
To him the mighty Periphas succeeds,
And the bold ἦ chief who drove his. fathcr’s steeds·;
With these the Scyrian 'nands advance, and aim
Full at the battlements the miffive flame.
Fierce Pyrrhus in the from with forceful sway 635
Ply’d the huge ax, and hew’d the beams away3
The solid timbcrs from the portal tore,
And rent from ev'ry hinge the brazen door.
At last the chief a mighty op'ning made,
And, all th' imperial dome, in all her length display'd :
The sacred rooms of Troy's first monarche lie, 641
With Priam's pomp, profan’d by every eye3
In arms the centries to the breach repair‚
And stand embody’d‚ to rcpel the war.
Now far within, the regal rooms disclose, 645
Loud and more loud, a dircful scene of wocs;

The roof resounds with female ihrieks and crieS‚
And the shrill echo strikes the distant sszies.

647. The roff reflanda] Ariosto has exaffiy and minutely
imitated this fine description in his Orlando Fui-ioso.

Sonar per gli alti e spatiosi letti
S ' odom gridi, e semim).y lamensi :
L' a tim· donne, percotendo ipati,
Com-on per casa pallide, e dolenti .·
E abbraciczn gli uscz' e ἱ geniali letti,
Che tqsto hanno a lascs'are astrane genti.
Cant. xvii. Stan. ¹3·
’Tis remarkable that Sir J. Harrington has totally omitted
this fine passage (as indeed he has many others) in his transsa-
tion of this celebrated Italian pcct. There are a great many
passages in Ariosto copied from thio, second book of virgil.
