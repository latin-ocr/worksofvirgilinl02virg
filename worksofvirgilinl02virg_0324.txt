Credo equidem (nec vana fides) genus ess‘e deorum.
Degeneres animos timor arguit. heu, quibus ille
Jatitatus fatis ! quae bella exhausta canebat!

Si mihi non animo fixum inmotumque sederet, 15'
Ne cui me vinclo vellem sociare jugali,

Postquam primus amor deceptam morte fefellit;

Si non pertaesum thalami taedaeque fuiffet3

Huic uni forsan potui succumbere culpae.

Anna, fatebor enim3 miseri post fata Si‘chaei γε
Conjugis‚ et sparsos fraterna caede Penatis,

Solus hic inflexit sensus, animumque labantem

Inpulit. agnosco veteris vestigia flammae.

Sed mihi vel tellus optem prius ima dehiscat,

Vel pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras, 25'
Pallentis umbras Erebi no<9oemque profundam, ¹
Ante pudor quam te violo, aut tua jura resolvo.

Ille meos, primus qui me fibi vinxit, amores

Abstulit. ille habeat secum, servetque sepulcro.

Sic effata sinum lacrimis inplevit obortis. 30

strong an d weighty ones; especially vt hc c she puts Dido in
mind, that she 1s surrounde d wi ish en mies ,that nothing could
