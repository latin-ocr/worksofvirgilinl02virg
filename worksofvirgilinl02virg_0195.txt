Book 2. THE AErcmn 01·- Vmon.. ⁷ 183

Begone—aequaint him with my crimes in Troy,

Anii tell my sire of his degenerate boy. 735
Di‘e then, he said, and dragg’d the monarch on,

Thro' the warm blood that iffu’d from his sons
Stagg’ring and ssiding in the ssipp'ry gore,

And to the shrine the royal viE’cim bore 3

Lock’d in the left he grasps the filver haire, 740
High in the right the flaming blade he rears,

Then to the hilt with all his force apply’d,

He plung’d the ruthless fau'chion in his fide.

Such was the fate unhappy Priam found,

. Vv⁷ho saw his Troy lie levell'd with the ground ; 745

He, who round Afia sent his high commands,
And stretch’d his empire o'er a hundred lande,
Now lies a headless carcass on the shore,
The man, the monarch, and the name no more !
Then, nor till then, I fear’d the furious foe, 750
Struck with that scene of unexampled w0e3
Soon as I saw the murder'd king expire :
His old competes, my venerable sire,
My palam, son, and confort left behind,
All, all, at once carne ruffiing on my mind. 755
I gaz’d around, but not a friend was there 3
My hapless friends, abandon'd to despair,
Had leap’d down headlong from the lofty spires,
Tir'd with their toils3 or plung⁷d amidst the fires.
Thus left alone, and wand'ring, I survey 760
where trembiing Helen close and filcnt lay

of old Priam, is very natural and moving. The distress is
now work'd up to the height. AEneas is left alone amid all
the dangers that surround him.

760. Thus lejft alama] varius and Tucca, who were ap-
pointed to revxse the AEneid‚ are said to have struck out the
twenty-two following verses in the original, as containing
some inconfistencies relating to Helen’s slight, and some ex-
preffions not agreeable to the purity of Virgil's style. Ca-
trou and Addison are for retrenching thern, but Dr. Trapp has
defended them at large, and thinks they deserve to stand in
their place. See Aouxsou's Travels‚ p. 4²2·⁶·
