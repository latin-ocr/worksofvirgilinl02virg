As to the second kind of thoughts, Virgil hath never
debased the dignity of epic poetry by introducing any
sentiments and images that arc: mean and vulgar. All
is uniformly majestic. He has never fallen into thoughts
that either are marso, or bordcring on burlesque3 of
which the refined and superficial Frcnch critics have so
frequently accused Homer, without making proper al·-
lowances for th: manners of those early ages. The dif-
ference between the Greek and Latin poet on this oc-
casion, together with the reason of such difference, hath
been well pointed out by the ingenious author of an En-
quiry into t'ne life and writings of Homer. virgil, says
he, had been accustomed to the splendor of a court, the
magnificence of a palace, and the grandeur of a royal
equipage ; accordingly his representations of that part of
life are more august and stately than Homer's. He has a
greater regard to decency, and those poliffied manners
which render men ⁴so much of a piece, and make them
all resemble one another in their conda& and behaviour.
His state defigns and political managements are finely
laid‚and carried on much in the spirit ofa courtier. The
eternity of a government‚ the forms of magistrature, and
plan of domnion, ideas to which Homer was a stranger,
are familiar with the Roman poet. But the Grecian’s
wiles are plain and natura13 either stratagems of war, or
such defigas in peace, as depend not upon forming a
