Book 2. Tus AENEID or Vmon.. 135

The fiercest Argive would with tears bewai1‚
And stern Ulyffes tremble at the tale : 10
And lo! the night precipitates away 3
The stass, grown dim before the dawning day,
Call to reposo ; but fince you long to know,
And eurious listen to the story’d woe 3
Tho’ my ihock’d soul recoils, my tongue shall tell, 15
But with a bleeding beart, how Ilion fell.
The Grecian kings, (for many a rolling year,
Repell’d by fate, and harrass’d by the war 3)
By Pallas‘ aid, of season'd fir compose
A steed, that tow’ring like a mountain rose : 20

the painter to take, for his subje&‚ that part of AEneas's story,
where, with his Penates, his father, and his son, he is pre-
paring to set fail for Italy. To draw Troy in flames, as a
constituent part of this pielure‚ would be manifestly absurd.
It would be painting two subjeR‘s, instead of one. And per-
haps Trcgja incenstz might seize the attention before

Ascanium Anchisenque patrem Teucrosque Penaaees.

But a distant perspefifive of burning Troy, might be throwr'x
into a corner ol the piece, that is episodically, with good .ιά-
vantage ; where instead of dissraffing the attention, and break-
ing the unity of the subjeffc, it would concenter‚ 35 it w ere,
with the great defign, and have· an effe& in augmssntlng the

distress of it.” Hunn's Notes on Horace’s arx ol poerry.
