Ev’n at the sacred altar in a strife

By stealth the tyrant {hed his brother’s life;

Blind with the charms of gold, his faulchion drove,
Stern, and regardless of his fister's love.

Then, with fond hopes, deceiv'd her for a time,
And forg'd pretences to conceal the crime. 470
But her unbury'd lord, before her sight,

Rose in a frightful vision of the night :

Around her bed he stalks; grim ! ghastly! pale Ι

And, staring wide, unfolds the horrid tale

Of the dire altars, dash'd with blood around3 475
Then bases his breast, and points to every wound3
Warns her to fly the land without delay 3

And to support her thro’ the tedious way, }
Shews where, in massy piles, his bury’d treasure lay.

Rous'd‚ and alarm'd, the wife her ssight intends, 480

Obeys the summons, and convenes her friends 2

They meet, they join, and in her cause engage,

All, who detest‚ or dread the tyrant's rage.

Some ships, already rigg’d, they seiz'd‚ and stow’d

Their fides with gold ; then launch'd into the flood. 485

They sail3 the bold exploit a woman guides:

Pygmalion's wealth is wafted o'er the tides.

They came, where now you see new Carthage rise,

And yon proud citadel invade the skies.

The wand'ring exiles bought a space of ground 400

Which one buil-hide inclos’d and compass’d round 5

Hence Byrsa nam’d : but now, ye strangers, say,

Who? whence you are? and whither lies your way ?
Deep, from his soul, he draws a length of sigini,

And, with a mournful accent, thus replics. 405

Should I, O goddess, from their source relate,

Or you attend, the annals of our fate,

The goldcn sun would sink, and cv'ning close,

Before my tonguc could tell you half our κνοω.
