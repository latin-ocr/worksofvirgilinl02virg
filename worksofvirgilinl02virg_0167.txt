Book 2. Tm AENEm oF Vmcu.. 155

All to the fatal labour bend their care,
Level the walls, and lay the hulwarks bare 3
Some round the lofty neck the cables tye, 315
Some to the feet the rolling wheels apply;
The tow'ring monster, big with Ilion's doom,
Mounts o'er the wall 3 an army in the womb :
Around xhe moving pile the children join
In {houts of transport‚ and in songs divine3 320
They run, they pull the stretching cords with joy,
And lend their little hands to ruin Troy!
In one loud peal th’ enormous horse rolls down,
And thund'ring gains the center of the town.
Oh Troy, renown'd in war ! Oh bright abodes! 325
Oh glorious Troy ἕ the Iabour of the gods ἵ ⁸
Thrice stop'd unmov’d the monster in the gnte,
And clashing arms thrice warn’d us of our fate3
But we, by madness blinded and o’ercome,
Lodge the dire monster in the sacred dome. 330
Cassandra too, inspir’d, our fate declares
(So Phoebus doom’d) to unregarding ears;
We, thoughtless wretches l deck the ffirhoes, and waste
In sports the day, which Heav’n decreed our last.

Now had the sun roll’d down the beamy light, 335
And from the caves of Occan rush'd the night3
With one black veil her spreading shades suppress
The face os nature, and the frauds of Greece.
The Trojans round their walls in silence lay,
And lost in sleep the labours of the day. 340
When lo ! their course the Grecian navy bore,
New rigg'd and arm’d‚ and reach'd the well-known shore,
By filcnt Cynthia’s friendly bearns convey’d3
And the proud admiral a flame display’d.
Then Sinon, favour’d by the partial gods, 345
Unlocks the mighty monster's dark abodes;

to have written a tragedy on that subjeffl and were sufficient to
confirm the Trojans in their belief of Sinon‘s story.
