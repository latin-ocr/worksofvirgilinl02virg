6 DISSERTATION.

stant and wearisorne attention, will necessarily be more
entertaining, than a confused heap of wild‚ unconneftech
and monstrous adventures. The greater the 3611011, the
more will it plcase and engage all rnen, as it is the natu-
ral foible and propensity of human nature to be delighted
with every thing that 13 above common life. The aetion
ought to be interesting, because 311 hearts feel pleasure
in being moved3 and a poem, however perfect, if it does
not touch and affec} 113, will be infipid and disregarded
at all times and in all countries; and the 3611011 ought tq

These remaiks are very applicable to 311 the episodes

connecting with his main subject, and of making them]
intimately essentia] to the sable. We meet with no unffi
natural mixture in the corre& and exa& oeconomy of 11113
poem, like the monsters Statius 1133 introduced in his
Thebaid. What affinity has the anger* of Venus, the
butchering of the Lemniam, the designs of the Argo-
muts, and the amours of Jason and Hypfipile, With the
quarte] between Eteocles and Polynices ? ’

An epic poem is not to be a history, like the Pharsalia
of Lucan, or the Punic war of Silius Italicus t nor the
whole life of a hero, like the AchilleIs of Statius. But
