Book 4. THE AENmn OF Vmon.. 333

What has his heir the young Ascanius done?
Why should he grudge an empire to his son ?
&Vhat scheme, what prospe& can the chief propose,
So long to loiter with a race of foes ? 345
The promis’d kingdom to regard no more,
And quite negle& the destin’d Latian shore ?
Haste-bid him fail—be this our will 3 and bear
With speed this mandate through the fields of air.
Swift at the word, the duteous son of NIay 350
Prepares th’ almighty’s orders to obey 3
First round his feet the golden wings he bound,
That speed his progress o'er the seas profound‚
Or earth’s unmeasur’d regions, as he flies‚
Wrap’d in a rapid whirlwind‚ down the skies. 355
Then grasp'd the wand ; the wand that calls the ghosts
From hell, or drives them to the Stygian coasts,
Invites or chases sseep with wond'rous pow'r,
And opes those eyes that death had seal'd before.
Thus arm’d, on wings of winds sublimely rode 360
Thro’ heaps of opening clouds the flying god.
From far huge Atlas' rocky fides he spies,
Atlas, whose head supports the starry skies :
Beat by the winds and driving fains, he shrouds
His shady forehead in surrounding clouds 3 365
With ice his horrid beard is crusted o'er 3
From his bleak brows the gufhing torrents pour ;
Out—-spread, his mighty ssmulders heave below
The hoary piles of everlasting snow.
Here on pois'd pinions stoop'd the panting god ; 370
Then, from the steep, {hot headlong to the flood.

363. Atlas, whose head supports the starty spica] This descrip-
ῐίοη of Atlas, as a person, is very sublime and pic‘Iuresque.
There is a famous statue of Atlas, in the Famese palace at
Rome, supporting the globe of the heavens. From this descrip-
tion in virgil, says Mr. Spence in his Polymetis, one might
form a very good idea for a mountain-statue ; as perhaps it was,
originally, taken from one.
