Book 3. >THE AENEm or Virmn„ 267

Has fixt his armies on Salentine ground,
And awes the wide Calabrian realrns around.
Here Philotaetes, from Theffalian shores,
Rears strong Petilia fenc’d with walls and tow'rs.
Soon as transported o'er the rolling floods, 540
You pay due vows in honour of the gods 3
fohen on the shore the smoking altars rise‚
A purple veil draw cautious o'er your eyes3
,Lest hostile faces should appear in sight,
To blast and discompose the hallow’d rite. 545
Observe this form before the sacred shrine,
Thou, and thy friends, and all thy future linc.
When near Sicilian coasts thy bellying sans
At length convey thee with the driving gales 3
Pelorus’ straits just opening by degree53 550
Turn from the right3 avoid the {hores and seas.
Far to the left thy course in safety keep,
And fetch a mighty circle round the deep.
That realm of old, a ruin huge! was rent
. In length of ages from the continent 3 555
With force convulfive burst the isse away 3
Through the dread op'ning broke the thund'ring sea :
s At once the thund'ring sea Sicilia tore,
And sunder'd from the fair Hes perian shore ;
And still the neighbouring coasts and towns divides 560
With scanty channels, and contrad-ed tides.

Virgil hath made a poetical use. Aurelius Victor relates, that
AEneas sacrificing on the {hore of Italy, suddenly perceived
Ulyffes and his fleet approaching; and for fear of being known,
covered his face with a purple veil. From this adventure,
virgil makes Helenus give AEneas a ceremonia! precept, for all
liis posterity. Such use does the poet make of the least histori-
cal circumstances in the life of his hero. (ῼΑΤκου.
