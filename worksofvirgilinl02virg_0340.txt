328 P. V1RG1L11 MAnoms ΑΕΝΕΙε. Lib. 4.

Extemplo Libyae magnas .it Fama per urbis 3

Fama, malum quo non aliud velocius ullum

Mobilitate viget, viresque adquirit eund03 175
Parva metu primo 3 mox sese adtollit in auras,
Ingrediturque solo, et caput inter nubila condit.

Illam Terra parens, ira inritata deorum,

Extremam, ut perhibent, Coeo Enceladoque sororem
Progenuit3 pedibus celerem, et pernicibus alis. 180
Monstrum horrendum, ingens ε quoi quot sunt corpore
Tot vigiles oculi subter, mirabile dictu, [plumae‚
Tot linguae, totidem ora sonant, tot subrigit auris.
Nolite volat caeli medio terraeque per umbras

Stridens, nee dulci declinat lumina somno. 185
Luce sedet custos aut summi culmine teeti,

Turribus aut altis, et magnas territat urbis 3

Tam fies-{i prauique tenax, quam nuntia veri.

pines with regret, ssie addresses her plaints to Heaven3 but all
her complaining and her grief is but for the loss osa man, and
being deprived of her plezisure. The charaCter Homer gives
to Calypso, by becoming so easily enamour'd of Ulyffes, gives
his hero no person-<il pre-eminence over AEneas. Dido’s com-
plaints are in another strain3 she deplores her stained glory,
her having sullied that reputation which had formerly exalted

her name to heaven :
‘Tepropter Libycae.

She thinks of the contempt with which neighbouring princes
must look upon her, having so often deipised them. ·The
image of Sichaeus, that moving tender image, is ever present
to her mind, and in the miserable condition ssie is now in,⁸ [he

has nothing left to desire but death ;
Qtin morere, ut merita es

She dies, and t'ne recital of her death presents us with such
natural beauties and touching images, that we must have re-
course to the most pathetic among the Greek tragedies, to sind
any thing to be compared with the end of the fourth book of
' the AEneid. What art, what dexterity is there in marking out
by the rag-e of Dido the source of the implacable hatred be-

tween the Lai-zhaginians and Romans!
