Sure he descends fromsome celestia] kind3

For fear attends the low degenerate mind.

But oh ! what wars, what battles he relates!
How long he struggled with his adverse fates !
Did not my soul henpurpose still retain,

Fix’d and determin’d ne'er to wed again,

Since from my widow'd arms the murdering sword
'Untimely snatch’d my first unhappy lord;

Did not my thoughts the name of marriage dread,
And the bare mention of the brida] bed—-
Forgive my frailty--but I seem instin’d

To yield to this one ‹makness of my mind.

For oh l my fister, unreserv’d and free

I trust the secret of my soul to thee;

Since poor sichaeus, by my brother ssain,
Daffl’d with his blood the consecrated fane,
And stain'd the gods 3 my firm resolves, I own,
This graceful prince has (hook, and this alone.
I feel a warmth o’er all my trembling frame,
Too like the tokens of my former flame.

But oh ! may earth her dreadful gulf display,
And gaping snatch me from the golden day;
May I be hurl'd‚ by heav'n's almighty fire,
Transfix’d with thunder and involv'd in fire,
Down to the shades of hell from realms of light,
The deep, deep ss1ades of everlasting night ς
Ere, sacred honour ! I betray thy cause

In word, or thought, or violate thy laws.

No !—my first lord, my first ill-fated spouse‚
Still, as in life, is lord of all my vows.

My love he had, and ever let him have,
Interr’d with him, and buried in the grave.

Then, by her rising grief 0’erwhelm’d‚ she ceas'd ε

The tears ran trickling down her hcaving breast.
