10 DISSERTA'TION.

carcsully. Hc is less of a soldier and more of a general
than Achilles. But this general in office sometimes for-
got himself, to a& the part of a private soldier. Had it
not been for this, hc might have put an end to the war
the very second day, when breaking into the entrench-
ments of AEneas‚ which he besieged, his fury made him
negle& to keep the passage open for his own men, as he
might easily have done. So far it is true that anger is
his principal chara<9oer; he was so sull of the idea of
Achilles, and so animated with the same spirit ς Go, says
he to Pandarus, when he killed him, go tell Priam thou
hast met with a second Achilles here. The poet makes
use of these remote hints and oblique artifices to {hew the
readcr the turn and ruling paffion of Turnus.

The charaeta of this hero partakes iil-:ewise of the in-
justice of Achilles, in thar, from his own particular
quarrel, he raises a general war, renders his anger perni-
cious to both parties, and more to his own than that of
the enemy z and exposes many thousand innocents for his

single interest. The blameable part of his charanstcr is ,

also concealed, as the vices of Achilles, by openness,
by generosxty‚ and by the dazzling lustre of a wonderful
contage.

These arc the most striking and the principal persons
in the poem. All the under charaelem though more
ssightly touched, are delineatcd and supported with equa}
beauty and justness.

mildness to Achaemenides3 the artful villainy and deli-

impiety and abandoned behaviour3 the malice and envy

more charming than the splendors of a modern court 3
