Book 2. THE AEmzm or V1RG11..

Dragg'd by the shouting vietors 3--t0 the skies
She rais’d, but rais’d in vain, her glowing eyes3

Her eyes—she could no more—the Grecian hands

Had rudely manacled her tender hand33
Cho'roebus could not bear that scene of woes;
But, fir’d with fury, ssew amidst the foes 3

As swift we follow to redeem the fair,

Rush to his aid, and thicken to the war.

Here from the temple on our troop descends

A storm of javelins from our Troj an friends,
Who from our arms and helmets deern'd us foes3
And hence a dreadful scene of ssaughter rose.
Then all the Greeks our ssender bands invade,
And pour enrag'd to seize the rescu'd maid 3
Ajax with all 'the bold Dolopians came,

And both the kings of Atreus’ royal name.

So when the winds in airy confli& rise,

Here south and west charge dreadful in the sszies ;

There louder Eurus, to the battle borne,
Mounts the swift coursers of the purple morn ;
Beneath the whirlwind roar the bending woods 3

With his huge trident Neptune strikes the floods :

foams, storms, and tempesting the deeps around,
Bares the broad bosom of the dark profound.
These too, we chas’d by night, a scatter'd train,
Now boldly rally, and appear again.

To thern our Argive helms and arms are known,
Our voice and language diff'ring from their own.
We yield to numbers. By Peneleus' stecl

First at Minerva⁷s shrine Choroebus fell.

'- Next Ripheus bled, the justest far of all

The sons of Troy 3 yet Heav'n permits his fall.

god5‚ is the lifting up their hands to heaven. Virgil frequent-
ly alludes to this paffage; particularly in the second book there
is a passage, the beauty of which is much raised by this con-
fideration. Popc's Notes‚ Iliad vi.
There is a fine Cassandra in the Florentine collection, in this

very attitude of disti-ess.
