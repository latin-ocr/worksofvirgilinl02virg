When, from the fibres, drops of crimson, gore
Ran trickling down, and stain'd the sable shore.
Amaz’d, I {hook with horror and affright,
My blood all* curdled at the dreadful sightj,
Curious the latent causes to explore‚ 40
With trembling hands a second plant I tore 3
That second wounded plant distill’d around
Red drops of blood, and sprinkled all the ground.
Rack’ d wi th a thousand fears, devout I bow’ d
>To every nymph, and Thracia' s guardian god, . 45
These ome ns to ax ert by pow 'r divine, ’
And kindly granta more auspicious sign.
But when once more we tugg’d with toiling hands,
And eager bent rny knees against the sand53
Live I to speak it ?-from the tomb I hear 50
A hollow giban, that fflock’d my trembling ear.
How can thy pious hands, AEneas, rend
The bury’d body of thy hapless friend ?
This stream that trickles from the wounded tree
Is Trojan blood, and once ally’d to thee. 55
Ah ! fly this barbe-„rous land, this guilty shore,
Fly, fly the fate of murder'd Poiydore.
’ This grove of lances, from my body ssain,
Now blooms with vegetable life again.
Then, as amaz'd in deep suspeneeI hung, 60
Fear rais'd my hair, and horror clxain’d my tongue.

When they believed every grove, and every tuft of trees, to
. have some particular divinities belonging to it; it was but one
step further to entertain the notion of intelligences vitally an·
nexed to a tree‚ which was their received notion of the Hama-
dryades. SeeBayle, Diei. Art. HAMAn.
