Which good Achates bore: his arrows fled3

And first he laid the lordly leaders dead3 255

Next all th’ ignoble vulgar he pursu’d,

And with his shafts dispers'd 'em thro’ the wood ;

Nor ceas’d the chief, ³511, stretch'd beneath his see t,

Lay sev'n huge stags, the number of his fleet-

⁴ Back to the port the vietor bends his way, 260

And with his friends divides the copious prey.

The generous wine to crown the genial feast,

Which kind Acestes gave his parting guest,

Next to his sad affociates he imparts;

And with these words revives their drooping hearts. 265
F riends ἔ we have known more tofis, than ‘now we

By long experience exercis’d in woe ; [kn0w,

And soon to these disasters shall be giv’n

A certain period by relenting Heav’n.

Think, how you saw the dire Cyclopean spere, 270

Heard Scylla's rocks, and all her monsters‚ roar.

Dismiss your fears 3 on these misfortunes past

Your minds with pleasure may refle& at last.

Thro' such varieties of woes‚ we tend

To promis'd Latium, where our toils {hall end : 275

Where the kind fates shall peaceful seats ordain,

And Troy, in all her glories, rise again.

With manly patience bear your present state,

And with firm courage wait a better fate.

So spoke the chief, and hid his inward smart 3 280 ,

Hope smooth'd his looks, but anguish rack'd his heart.
The hungry crowd prepare, without delay,

To dress the banquet, and to ssmre the prey.

Some from the body strip the smoking hide,

Some cut in morscls‚ and the parts divide3 285
These bid, with busy care, the flames aspire3

Those roast the limbs, yet quiv'ring o'er the fire.

Thus, while their strength and spirits they restore,

The brazen cauldrons smoke along the shore.
