Book 1. THE AENEID or Vmon„ 83

What have my poor exhausted Trojans done ? 310
Or what, alas l my deas unhappy son ?

still, for the sake of Italy, deny'd

All other regions, all the world beside ?

Sure, once you promis’d, that a race divine

Of Roman chiefs ffiould spring from Teucer’s line ;
The world in future ages to command, 316
And in the empire grasp the sea and land.

Oh Ι sov’reign father, say ! what cause could move

The fix’d unalterable word of Jove ?

Which sooth'd my grief, when Ilion felt her doom; 32&
And Troy I balanc’d with the fates of Rome.
'But see l their fortune stili pursues her blow5

WVhen wilt thou fix a period to their woe ἓ

In safety, bold Antenor broke his way

Thro’ hosts of foes, and pierc'd th’ Illyrian hay, 325
Where, thro’ nine ample mouths, Timavus pours,
Wide as a sea, and deiuges the {hores 3 }
The flood rebellows, and the mountain roars3

Yet with his coionies‚ secure he came,

Rais'd Padua's walls, and gave the realms a name. 330
Then fix'd his Trojan arms 3 his labours cease5

And now the hoary monarch reigns in peace.

But we, your progeny, ordain’d to rise,

And {hare th’ eternal honours of the (kies,

To glut the rage of one, our vessels lost, 335
Barr’d by her vengeance, from the promis’d coast.

Are these the palms that virtue must obtain,

And is our empire thus restor’d again ?

The sire of men and gods, superior, smil’d

On the sad queen, and gently kiss'd his child. 340
Then, with those looks that clear the clouded ficies,

And calm the raging tempest, he replies.

Daughter, dismiss your fcars ; by doom divine

Fix'd are the futes of your immortal line.
