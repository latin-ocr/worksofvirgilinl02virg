Book 1. THE AExzmn 01- Vmcn„ 103

Struck with the view, oh ἔ friend, the hero eries,
(Tears‚ as he spoke, came starting from his eyes) 615
Lo! the wide world our miseries employ 3
What realm abounds not with the woes of Troy ?
See ! where the venerable Priam stands ἔ
See virtue honour’d in the Libyan sands i
For Troy, the generous tears of Carthage fl0w; 620
(And Tyrian breasts are touch'd with human woe.
Now banish fear, for fince the Trojan name
Is known, we find our safety in our farne.
Thus while his soul the moving phsture fed,
A show’r of tears the groaning hero shed. ¹ 625
For here, the fainting Greeks in ssight he view'd 3
And there the Trojans to their walls pursu'd
By plum’d Achilles, with his dreadful spear,
Whirl’d on his kindling chariot thro' the war.
Not far from thence, proud Rhaesus' tents he knows 630
By their white veiis, that match’d the winter snows‚
Betray'd and stretch'd amidst his ssaughter’d train,
And, while he ssept, by fierce Tydides ssain 3
Who drove his coursers from the scene of blood,
Ere the fierce steeds had tasted Trojan food, 635}
Or drank divine Scamander’s fatal flood.
There Troilus 'flies disarm’d (unhappy boy I)
From stern Achilles, round the fields of Troy :
Unequal he ἶ to such an arm in war !
Supine, and trailing frorn his empty car, 640
Still, tho' in death, he grasps the flowing reins, Δ
His startled coursers whirl him o'er the plains ;
The spear inverted strcaks the dust around;
His snowy neck and treffes sweep the ground.
Mean time a pcnfive supplicating train 645
Of Trojan matrons, to Minerva’s fane
In sad proceffion with a robe repair‚
Beat their white breasts, and rend their golden hair.
