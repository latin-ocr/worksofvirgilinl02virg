8 DISSERTATION.

The case is the same in the Epopocia. Each atstor must
be represented in a greater or less degree of strength, ac-
cording to the part he sustains. The grand and principal
figure in the poem before us is AEneas; on whom all the
actions of each inferior character dcpend, and who con-
sequently, is the foul of the whole piece. AEneas is led
by the prophecies of the Gods to establiih a new kingdom ;
accordingly, we see him taking all opportunities of prac-
tising religious duties; and as this is his most eminent
virtue, Virgil almost every where dignifies him with the
epithet pius. Though the frequent repetition of the
word pius may be thought tautology and idleness in the
poet, yet that epithet eonveys with it the design of the
whole poem, namely, that of founding a new state ac-
cording to the dietates of Heaven. This charaeteristic
piety of the hero, occasions a fine contrast between him
and Turnus, where the league is broken in the twelfth
book. In short, whatever he does is enjoined or regu-
lated by religionj, consequently he is just, merciful, and
genereus. Thus he is a far more amiable character than
that of Achilles, or Ulyffes; fince the affions of the
former are almost all founded on revenge, and of the
latter on diffimulation. But characters may be poetically
good, that are not morally so.

Next to our hero, Dido a&s the most considerable part
in the first six books, and is the charaeler, on which the
plot and intrigue of them turns. She is the foundress of
Carthage, as AEneas is the founder of Rome, and she
represents the obstacle which this republic laid in the
way of the Roman vietories, which were to make that
state the mistress of the world. She is bold, paffionate,
ambitious, perfidious : but her most distinguishing charac-
teristic is diffimulation. It is by this she revenges her hus-
band, punishes her brother, and deceives Iarbas. It is
by this she would retard AEneas’s journey; but not being
able to succeed in that scheme, she deceives her sister and

confident.
