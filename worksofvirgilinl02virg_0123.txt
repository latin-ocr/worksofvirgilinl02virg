Book 1. ‘ruz AENEm 01·- Vmcu. 111

Permit us, from your woods, new planks and oars

To fell, and bring our veffels on your stiores3 745
That‚ if our prince and friends return again,

With· joy, from Latium, we may plough the main.

But if these hopes are vaniffi'd quite away,

If lost, and swallow'd in the Libyan sea,

You lie, great guardian of the Trojan state, 7 50
And young Iiilus {hares his father’s fate3
Oh ! let us seek Sicilia’s shores again, Ἰ

And fly from hence to good Acestes' reign.

He spoke 3 a loud assent ran murmuring thro’ the train. 5
Thus then, in short, the gracious queen replies, 755

While on the ground {hefixt her modest eyes ;

Trojans, be bold3 against my will, my fate,

A throne unsettled‚ and an infant state,

Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs,

And guard with these severities my shores. 760

Lives there a stranger to the Trojan name,

Their valour, arms, and chiefs of mighty fame?

We know the war that set the world on fire3

Nor are so void of sense the sons of Tyre;

For here his beams indulgent Phoebus fheds, 763

And rolls his flaming chariot o’er our heads.

Seek you, my friends, the blest Saturnian plains‚

Or fair Trinacria, where Acestes reigns ?

With aids supply'd‚ and furniih’d from my stores,

Safe will I send you from the Libyan fflores. 770

Or would you stay to raise this growing town ε

Fix here your seat3 and Carthage is your own.

Haste, draw your ships to shore3 to me the same,

Your Troy and Tyre shall differ but in name.

And oh! that great AEneas had been tost, “ 775

By the same storm, on the same friendly coast l “

because it did not appear to him that Dido was obliged to know
who this Iiilus was. Perhaps this may be one of those little over-
fights which Vir il would have corre&ed‚ had he lived to make
this poem as pet e& as the Georgics.
