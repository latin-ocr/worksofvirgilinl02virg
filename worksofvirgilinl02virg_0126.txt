114· Ρ. VIRGILII MAnoms Aturus. Lib. 1.

Usquam justitiae est, et mens fibi conscia recti,

Praemia digna ferant. quae te tam laeta tulerunt 605
Saecula ? qui tanti talem genuere parentes?

In freta dum fluvii current, dum montibus umbrae
Lustrabunt convexa, polus dum sidera pascet ς

Semper honos, nomenque tuum, laudesque manebunt:
Qae me cumque vocant terrae. 'sic fatus‚‘ amicum 610
Ilionea petit dextra, laevaque Serestum:

Casu deinde viri tanto. et sic* ore locuta 'este

Quis te, gnate dea, per tanta pericula casus 6¹5

Ipse hostis Teucros insigni laude ferebat, 625
Seque ortum antiqua Teucrorum ab stirpe volebat.

might conceive but little hopes of deraining him at Carthage.

829. Dido gaz'd him o'er.] Here was the beginning of that
violent paffion Dido afterwards felt for AEneas.

833. And now I call to mind] lt is a very artful stroke in the
poet to make Dido know something of AEneas's family and
astions, which renders this hospitable reception, from a stranger, .
more natura13 and inclined her to a favour-able opinion of him
at first sight. The sentiment with which 1he concludes her
