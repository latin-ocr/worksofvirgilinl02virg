Book 4. Tm: AEmtm 01- Vmou.. 377

Her bosom groaning with convulfive pain,
She strives to raise her heavy lids in vain,
And in a moment finks‚ and swoons again. }
Prop⁷d on hei· elb0w‚ thrice she rear'd her head,
And thrice fell back, and fainted on the bed 3 995
Sought with her swirnming eyes the golden light,
And saw the sun, but ficken’d at the fight.
Then mighty Juno‚ with a melting eye,
Beheld her dreadful anguiih from the sky3
And bade fair Iris, from the starry pole, 1000
F1y‚ and enlarge her agonizing soul :
For as she dy’d by love before the time,
Nor fell by fate, nor perish’d for a crime,
Nor yet had Proserpine, with early care,
Clip’d from her head the fatal golden hair ; 2 1005
Thefiolemn offering to the pow’rs below,
'170 free the spirit, and relieve her woe.
Swist from the glancing sun the goddess drew
A thousand mingling colours‚ as she flew:
Then radiant hover’d o’er the dying fail-3 1010
And 10 1 this consecrated lock I bear
To Stygian Jove t and now, as Heav'n ordains,
Release thy soul from these corporeal chains.
The goddess stretch'd her hand, as thus ihe said,
And clipt the sacred honours of her head ς 1015
The vital spirit flies, no more confin’d,

Dissolves in air, and mingles with the wind.

THE END OF THE FOURTH Boot.
