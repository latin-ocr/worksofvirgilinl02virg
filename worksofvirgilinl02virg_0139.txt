The truths‚ which ancient Atlas taught, he fings,

And nature's secrets, on the founding strings.

'vVhy Cynthia changes 3 why the sun retires,
‚Shorn of his radiant beams, and genial fires3

From what originals‚ and causes, came . 1005
Mankind and beasts, the rain, and rifing flame ;
Are’mrus, dreadful with his stormy star;

The wat'ry Hyads, and the northern car ·‚
