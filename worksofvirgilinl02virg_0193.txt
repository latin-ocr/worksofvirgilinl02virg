Book 2. THE AENEm oF V1RGIL. 181

And oh ! may ev'ry violated god,

Barbarian ! ‘thank thee for thie deed of blood 3

(If gods there are, such atstions to regard‚)

Oh l may‘they give thy guilt the full reward3

Guilt, that a father’s sacred eyes defil’d 720
With blood, the blood of his dear murder'd child !
Unlike thy lire, Achilles the divine!

(But sure Achilles was no sire of thine l)

Foe as I was, the heroe deign'd to hear

The guest’s, the suppliant’s, king's, and father's prayer;
To funeral rites restor'd my Hedor ssain, 726
And safe dismiss'd me to my realm again.

This said, his trembling arm effay’d to throw

The dull dead javelin‚ that scarce reach'd the foe;

The weapon languishingly lagg'd along, 730
And, guiltless, on the buckler faintly rung.

Thou then be first, replies the chief, to go

With these sad tidings to his ghost below ;

his most favourite charat‘ters with these barbarities. That of
Ascanius over Numanus in the ninth‚ was a fair opportunity
where Virgil might have indulged the humour of a cruel
raillery, and have been excused by the youth and gaiety of
the speaker3 yet it is no more than a very moderate answer to
the insolencies with which he had just been provoked by his
enemy, only retorting two of his own words upon him.

I, verbis virtutem illudesuperbis .‘
Bis capti Phryges haec Rutulis responsa remittunt.

He never suffers his AEneas to fall into this praefice, but while
he is on fire with indignation after the death of his friend
Pallas: That short one is the best that could be said to such a
tyrant ι

 

Ubi nunc Mezentius acer, et illa

 

Effera vis animi ?-—
The worst-natured oneI remembcr (which yet is more excu-
sable than Homer’s,) is that of Turnus to Eumedes in the
twelfth book,

En, agros et quam bello, ‘Tro-jane, petisti,
Hesperiam metire jacens : haec praemia, qui me
Ferro aust tentare, serunt .· fic moenia condunt.

This note is so full of just criticism on so many passages of our

author, that its length does nro? want any excuse.
