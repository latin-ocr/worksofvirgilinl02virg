350 P. V1RG1L11 MAnoms Aemus. Lib. 44..

Improbe amor, quid non mortalia pectora cogis ?

Ire iterum in lacrimas, iterum tentare precando

Cogitur, et supplex animos submittere amori :

Ne quid inexpertum frustra moritura relinquat. 413
Anna, vides toto properari litore : circum .

Undique convenere : vocat jam carbasus auras:
Puppibus et laeti nautae inposuere coronas.

Hunc ego fi potui tantum sperare dolorem,

Et perferre, soror, potero. miserae hoc tamen unum 420
Exsequere, Anna, mihi. solam nam perfidus ille ¹
Te colere, arcanos etiam tibi credere sensus:

Sola viri mollis aditus, et tempora noras.

I, soror, atque hostem supplex adfare superbum 2

Non ego cum Danais Trojanam exscindere gentem 425
Aulide juravi, classemve ad Pergama mifi :

Nec patris Anchisae cinerem manisve revelli.

Cur mea dieta negat duras demittere in auris ?

Qo ruit ? extremum hoc miserae det munus amanti ε
ΕΧΓρεᾶὶεῑ facilemque fugam, ventosque ferentis. 430
Non jam conjugium antiquum, quod prodidit, oro;
Nec pulchro ut Latio careat, regnumque relinquat.

603. Sister‚ behold] Here is a fine turn of passion. Dido's
last speech was full of rage, anger, indignati0n‚ at her disco-
very of AEneas’s defign to leave her: now she softens her style,
and falls into all the humble and supplicating arguments she
could invent. The poet artfully makes the reader take notice
of the change,

Ire iterum in lacrymas, iterum tentare precando
Cogitur, et supplex animos submittere amori. 413.

How moving is that partos this speech, where she defires her
{ister to tell AEneas, that she now does not presume to detain
him from his voyage and keep him from his destined settlement‚
but that she only begs him to stay a little longer at Carthage,
till she had learnt in some measure to subdue her grief3 and
overcome the unexpecled blow; and till her bad fortune was
grown more familiar to her mind !

613. In all his thoughts] It is the true language o'f despairing
love, to make the person so affected imagine, that every body
else is preferred before itself‚ and to express itself with a kind.
of pathetic- etz-vy at such superior happiness.
