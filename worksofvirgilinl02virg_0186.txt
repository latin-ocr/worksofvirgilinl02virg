, §74 P. Vlizcum MA‘RoNx& Αεκέιε. Lib. ἐς

Vestibulum ante ipsum primoque in limine Pyrrhus
Exsultat telis, et luce coruscus ahena. 470
Qualis ubi in lucem coluber mala gramina pastus3
Frigida sub terra tumidum quern bruma tegebat,

Nunc positis novus exuviis nitidusque juventa,-

Lubrica convolvit sublato pedion: terga

Arduus ad solem, et linguis micat ore trisulcis; 475
Una ingens Periphas, ct equorum agitator Achillis
Armiger Automedon3 una omnis Scyria pubes
Succedunt tetS’m, et flammas ad culmina jafiram.-

Ipse inte-r primos conrepta dura bipenni

Limina perrumpit, postesque a cardine vellit 480'
Aeratos : jamque excisa trabe firma cavavit

Roborajet ingentem lato dedit ore fenestram.

Adparet dornus intus, et atria longa patescunt:
Adparent Priami et veterum penetralia regum:
Armatosque vident stantis in limine primo. 485'
At domus interior gemitu miseroque tumultu

R'Iiscetum penitusque cavae plangoribus aedes

Femineis ululant. ferit aurea sidera clamor.

623. So from his dem] This compar-ison is copied· from
Homer, ΙΙ. X. v. 93. “ virgil (says Dr. Theobald) speaks
of the serpent, mala gramina pastus, as if poisonous herbs were
his ordinary and constant diet: Homer, Ι think with more
propriety, and a more intimate knowledge of nature, mentions
the serpent as having eat poison, just when he meant to lie in
wait, and was prepar'd for mischief. Αιέξκ nemo-s, βεᾱξωκως
καωια &agyam-¹ AEiian (Lib. vi. C. 4.) in his history Of ani-³
mais, mentions this custom of the serpent, and says it is al·
luded to by Homer.''

645. No-wfar atisk-in] The women in Greece, and all over
the cast (as the cussom holds to this day) had their apartments
quite distinet from those of men, in the inner and most retired
part of the house. For their chambers to be broken open and
violated was the most dreadful of calamities. Servius tells us,
that all this fine paffage is taken from Ennius’s description of
the siege of Alba; which Livy has so nobly painted in the first
book of his history. The custom of kiffing beds, columns, and
doors, before they were oblig’d to quit them, is mentioned «
frequently by Sophocles and Euripide& ”’
