Book 2. THE AENi-:m or V1RG11.. 143

Tho' false the charge, the glorious heroe bled,

But now the Greeks deplore the warrior dead.

Me, yet a youth, my father sent to {hare 110

With him, my kinsman, in the toils of war.

Long as that heroe stood secure from fate,

Long as his counsels prop'd the Grecian state,

Ev’n I could boast an honourable name,

And claim some title to a {hare of fame; 115

But when the prince‚ (a well-known truth I tell,)

By dire Ulyffes' asts and envy fell ;

Soon as he ceas'd to breathe this vital air,

I drag'd my days in darkness and despair.

And, if kind Heav’n shou’d give me back once more 120

Safe and triumphant to my native shore,

For innocence condemn’d‚ revenge I yow’d,

Mad as I was, and spoke my rage aloud.

This mov'd Ulysses' hate, and hence arose

My past misfortunes‚ and my present woes. 125

Eager he fought the meam, and watch’d the time

To charge me too with some pretended crime.

For conscious of his guist, my death he vow'd,

And with dark hints amus'd the list’ning crowd.

At length with Calchas he concerts the scheme— 130

But why, why dwell I on this hateful theme?

Or why detain you with a tale of woe ?

Since you determine ev’ry Greek, a foe.

Strike‚ strike3 th' Atrides will my death enjoy,

And dire Ulyss'es thank the sword of Troy. 135
Now blind to Grecian stands, we burn to know

With fond desire the causes of his woe ;

Who thus, still trembling as he stood, and pale,

Pursu‘d the moving'melancholy tale.

Donec Calchante ministro——
Tum vero ardemus scitari.

‘Tis indeed improved in tne latter;⁴ he has all the use of
ᾖ Homet's suspense without the tediouscis of it.''

Effay on Pope's Odyss'ey, Part. ii. 43.
