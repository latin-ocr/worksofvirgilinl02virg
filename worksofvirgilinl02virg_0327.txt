Book 4. THE AENEm 01·- Vmon„

sister, the fair replies, whom far above
The light of heav’n, or life itself I love;

Still on your bloom {hall endless sorrow prey,
And waste your youth in solitude away ?

And shall no pleafing theme your thoughts employ ἓ

The prattling infant, or the bridal joy ?
Think you such cares disturb your husband’s shade,
Or stir the sacred ashes of the dead ?

What though before, no lover won your grace,
Among the Tyrian, or the Libyan race ἓ

With just disdain you pass'd Iarbas o'er,

And many a king whom warlike Afric bore,
But will you fly the hero you approve ?

And steel your heart against a prince you Iove?
Nor wiss you once reflecst what regions bound
Your infant empire, and your walls surround ?
Here proud Gaetulian cities tow'r in air,
VVhose swarthy sons are terrible in war;

There the dread Syrtes stretch along the main,
And there the wild Bareas-ans range the plain ς
Here parch’d with thirst a smoking region lies,
There fierce in arms the brave Numidians rise-
Why {hould I urge our vengeful brother’s ire ?
The war just bursting from the gates of Tyre ,Ρ
Sure, every god, with mighty Juno, bore
The fleets of Ilion to the Libyan shore.

From such a marriage, soon your joyful eyes
shall see a potent town and empire rise.

What scenes of glory Carthage must enjoy,
When our confederate arms unite with Troy ?
Go then, propitiare Heav’n 3 due off’rings pay ;
Caress, invite your godlike guest to stay,

. And study still new causes of delay.

Tell him, thar, charg'd with deluges of rain,
Orion rages on the wintry main ·,
