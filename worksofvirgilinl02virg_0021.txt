DISSERTATION. 9

confident. However, Virgil has given her some virtues
truly royal. She is magnificent, courteous, and loves to
reward what is praise-worthy. Sunt hic etiamsuapraemz'a
laudi. AEn. iv. She is hospitable to excesS, as is evident
by her entertaining the Trojans after the fflipwreck, and
this, before her attachment,to AEneas.

In the second part of the poem there are a great many
more interested persons than in the first. Latinus is a
very good and pious prime, but old and without sons.
This gives the queen an occasion of disobeying his or·-
ders, and Turnus a defire of being his son-in-law in
spite of him, and of forcing the good old man to pro·
claim war against AEneas, and of making use of his sub-
· jecTts, his arms, and authority. This default of autho-
rity is natural and ordinary among kings that have no
heirs.

Amata assumes a kind of right to dispose of her daugh-
ter. She is strongly in the interest of her kinsman Tur-
nus. She is so obstinately bent upon having him for
. her son-in-law‚ that she had rather die than change her
resolution. This obstinacy of the woman puts her upon
trying a variety of expedients, keeps up her anger and
violence, and is the principa} character the poet gives
her.

The charaaer of Turnus is the same with that of
Achilles, as far as the alteration of the design, and the
difference of the fable would admit. We see in him a
young man, of a furious and vehement temper, pas-
fionately in love with a princess whom a foreign rival
would rob him of. His mind is deeply fixed upon arms
and war, without considering whether this be just, or
whether the want of justice, and the contrary orders of
the Gods, make it crimina} and impious. He suffers him-
self at every turn to be transported with anger, the most
prevailing of all his paffions. This is the first idea our
poet gives of him, and which he always sustains very

carefully.
