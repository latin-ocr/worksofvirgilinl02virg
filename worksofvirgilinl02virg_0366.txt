354 P. V1RG1L11‘MARON18 Aenus* ·†Lib. 4.

Praeterea fuit in tediis de marmore templum

Conj ugis antiqui, miro quod honore colebat,

Velleribus niveis et festa fronde revinaum.

Hinc exaudiri voces et verba vocantis 460·
Visa viri 3 nox curn terras obscura teneret τ

Solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo

Saepe queri, ct longas in fletum ducere voces.

Multaque praeterea vatum praedicta piorum

Terribili monitu horrificant. agit ipse furentem 465
In somnis ferus Aeneas: semperque relinqui

Sola fibi, semper longam incomitata videtur

Ire viam, ac Tyrios deserta quaerere terra.

Eumenidum veluti demens videt agmina Pentheus,

Et solem geminum, et duplicis se ostendere Thebas ·. 470·
Aut Agamemnonius scaenis agitatus Orestes ·‚

Armatam facibus matrem ct serpentibus atris

Cum fugit, ultricesque sedent in limine Dirae.

In each low wind methinks a spirit calls,
And more than echoes talk along the walls.
Here as 1 watch‘d the dying lamps around,
from yonder shrine 1 heard a hollow found:
Come, sister, come, it said or seem'd to say,
Thy place is here, sad sister, come away l

681. So Pentheus« rav’k] Euripides, the most pathetic of
all tragic writers whatever, seems particularly to have excelled
in painting madness: Virgil has copied this simile from two·
of his tragedies: he has transsated the very words: και μην
ὃρᾳν μοι δυο μεν ianae< ὃοκω, Sao-m< ἓε Θκςας. Et vero videre
mihi duos quidem Jbles videor, duplicesque Thebas. This passage
is fou-nd in the Bacchantes of Euripides. l have frequently
wondered, that Longinus never quoted this description of the
madness of Pentheus as an instance of the> sublime. The de-
scription of the Bacchanalian women tearing Pentheus in
pieces, for secretly inspeffing their mysteries, is worked up
with the greatest sire, and the truest poetical enthufiasm. And
there is not a finer passage throughout the Greek tragedies.
Theocritus has likewise noblv described this event. Longinus
greatly admires the paffage'of Euripides from which Virgil
imitated this descripti0n3 and indeed human imagination can-
scarce conceive any thing painted so strongly.

Ω μητεξ, turrem σε μτ, ι’,τιςειε μοι
Τεις αἱματωπες και ἔρακοντωιῗεις togae.
Αυται γαρ, auras ωλησιιν ἓξωτιιεσι μοι.
