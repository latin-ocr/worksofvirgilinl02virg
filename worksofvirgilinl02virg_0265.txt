Book 3. THE AENmD OF V1R01L. ’ 253

Close in the grasS‚ observant of the word,

They hide the shining ss1ield, and gleaming sword.
Then‚ as the Harpyes from the hills once more 3²0
Pour'd ffirieking down, and crowded round the shore,
On his high st-and Misenus sounds from far

The brazen trump, the signal of the war.

With unaccustom’d fight we flew, to ssay

The forms obscene, dread monsters of the sea. 325
But proof to steel their hides and plumes remain,

We strike th' impenetrable fiends in vain,

Who from the fragments wing th' aerial way,

And leave, involv’d in stench, the mangled prey;

All but Celaeno 3--from a pointed rock ' 330
Where perch'd {he sate, the boding Fury spoke:

Then was it not enough, ye sons of Troy,

Our flocks to ssaughter, and our herds destroy ?

But war, {hall impious war your wrongs malinam,

And drive the Harpyes from their native reign ? 335
Hear then your dreadful doom with due regard,

Which mighty Jove to Phoebus has declar’d 3

Which Phoebus open'd to Celaeno's view,

And I, the Furies queen, unfold to you.

To promis'd Italy your course you ply, 34⁶> ι

And safe to Italy at length shall fly3

But never, never raise your city there,

’ ’Till‚ in due vengeance for the wrongs we bear,

Imperious hunger urge you to devour

. Those very boards on which you fed before. 345
She ceas'd, and fled into the gloomy wood.

With hearts dejeeted my companions stood, }

And sudden horrors froze their curdling blood.

Down drop the {hicld and spem-3 from fight we cease,

And humbly sue by suppliant vows for peace3 350

and he puts this oracle into the mouth of an Harpy. It here
makes a fine episode. We ssmll see by and by the completion
of this prophecy, which now detains the mind of the render
in suspeuce. Cim-nou.
