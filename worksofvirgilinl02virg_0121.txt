Book 1. ’ Tm: AEm-:m 01·- VIRGIL. ¹09

Oh! check your subjeti'ts, and their rage reclaim,

Ere their wild fury wrap our fleet in flame.

Oh ! save a pious race3 regard our cry 3

And view our anguiih with a melting eye. 710
We come not, mighty queen, an hostile band,

With sword and fire, and, ravaging the land,

To bear your spoils triumphant to the shore ε

No--to such thoughts the vanquish’d durst not soar.
Once by Oenotrians till’d, there lies a place, 715
’Twas call’d Hesperia by the Grecian tace,

(For martial deeds and fruits, renown’d by fame)

But smce Italia, from the leader’s name3

To that blest shore we steer'd our destin’d way,

When sudden, dire Orion rous’d the sea3 720
All charg’d with tempests rose the baleful star,

And on our navy pour'd his wat’ry war3

With sweeping whirlwinds cast our veffels wide,

Daih’d on rough rocks, or driving with the tide:

The few sad relies of our navy bore 725
Their course to this unhospitable shore.

What are the customs of this barbarous place?

What more than savage this inhuman sace?

In arms they rise, and drive us from the strand,

From the last verge, and limits of the land. 730
Know, if divine and human laws you ssight,

The g0d5‚ the gods will all our wrongs requite; }
Vengeance is their'53 and their's to guard his right.

AEneas was our king, of high renown;

Great, good, and brave3 and war was all his own. 735
If still he lives, and breathes this vital air, ’

Nor we, his friends and subjeets, shall despair3

Nor you, great queen, repent, that you employ

Your kind compaffion in the cause of Troy.

Befid‘es, on high the Trojan ensigns soar, ’με
And Trojan cities grace Sicilia’s shore;

Where great Acestes, of the Dardan strain,

Deriv’d srom ancient Teucer, holdc. his reign.
