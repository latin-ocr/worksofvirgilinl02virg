Book 3. THE AENEm oF Vmcn.. 285

WVhen, from the wood, {hot sudden'forth in view

A wretch, in rags that ssutter’d as he ssew. ⁷

The human form in mcager hunger lost3

The supphant stranger, more than half a ghost, 800}
Strctch'd forth his hands, and pointed to the coast.

We turn'd to view the fight 3—his vest was torn,

And ali the tatter’d garb was tagg’d with thorn.

His heard hangs long, and dust the wretch distains2,

ὁ ” And scarce the shadow of a man remains. 805

In al} befides, a Grecian he appears,

And late a soldier in the Trojan wars.

Soon as our Dardan dress and arms he view’d‚

In fear suspended for a space he stood ;

stood, stop'd, and paus'd 3 then, springing forth, he flles

All headlong to the shore with pray'rs and eries : 811

Oh ! by this vital air, the stars on high,

By every pitying pow'r who treads the sky! ¹

Ye mejans, take me hence 3 I ask no more3

But bear, oh bear me from this dreadful shore. 813

I own myseIf a Grecian, and confess

I storm'd your Ilion with the sons of Greece.

If that offence must doorn me to the grave,

Ye Trojans‚ plunge me in the whelming wave.

I die contented, if that grace I gain3 820
dic with plcasure, if I die by man.

Then kneel’d the wretch‚ and suppliant·c1ung around
My knecs with mars, aad grochd on the ground.
Μον’(] with his eries, wc urge 'nim to relate
His name, his lineage, and his crue] fat: ε 823
Then by the hand my good old father took.

The trembling youth, who thus encourag'd spoke.

Ulyffes' friend, your cmphc to destwy,

· I left my native Ithaca for Troy:

le fise, poor Adamastus‚ sent from far 830
Hic. son, his Achaemenides, to war3
Oh? had vs: both ou:⁴ humbk· state ιηῆῗηίπῐιιἬ,

And safc in peace :tud povcrty remain'd Ξ
