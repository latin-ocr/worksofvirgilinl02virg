Non prius aspicies, ubi fessum aetate* parentem

Liqueris Anchisen ? superet conjuxne Creiisa,
Ascaniusque puer ? quos omnis undique Graiae

Circum errant acies : et, ni mea cura resistat,

Jarn flammae tulerint, inimicus et hauserit ensis. 600
Non tibi Tyndaridis facies invisa Lacaenae,

Culpatusve Paris.. divom inclementia, divom Ι

Has evertit opes, sternitque a culmine Trojam. ι

(Aspice : namque omnem, quae nunc obducta tuenti
Mortalis hebetat visus tibi, et humida circum 605
caligat, nubem eripiam: tu ne qua parentis

Juss'a time, neu praeceptis parere recusa)

Hic, ubi disjetfftas moles, avolsaque saxis

Saxa vides, mixtoque undantem pulvere furnum,
Neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti 610
Fundamenta quatit 3 totamque a sedibus urbem

Emit. hic Juno Scaeas saeviffima portas

814. There Neptune's trident.]⁷ This imagery is magnificent
and sublime3 the thought of Venus's clearing his eye, and
{hewing him the Gods at work in destrcying the city, is nobly
conceiv'cd. I apprehend this to be one of the sublimest pas-
sages in Vix-gil’s waiting& and indeed it is comparable to any
thing in Homer, the greatest commendation that can be given
1t.

The hint seems to have been given by Homer, Iliad V. 127.
And this „ :ffage has bccn imitated by Milton, Book xi, 411.
and by '1-23'0, Canto xviii. Stanza 93. But the following
paffage in :sne Old Testament, greatly cxceeds azl the before-
mentioned ones: ·“ And Eliffia prayed and said, Loxd, Ι pray
thee open his eyes that he may see. And the Lord opened
the eyes of the young man, and he saw; and behold, the
mountain was full of horses, and chariots of fire, round about
Elilha.'³ Book of Kings, 2. C. 6. 17.

816. IIeav'n's aweful queen, &cst In the ancient gems
and marbles the Juno Matrona is always represented⁴in a mo-
dest and decent dress; as the juno Regina, and the Juno
Moneta, are always in a fine and more magnificent one: Yet
when one has formed an idea of Juno, either from the frmpli-
city of the one, or the magnificence ofthe others, one is still at a
loss what to make of Virgil’s account of her arms and military
chariot in the first AEneid (ver. 17.) or of that angry and war-
likc figure he has given of her in this pass'age. ,
