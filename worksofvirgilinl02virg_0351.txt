Book 4. THE AENEID 01- Vmom. 339

What are thy hopes from this thy long deiay? 395
Why thus in Libya pass thy hours away?

If future empire cease thy thoughts to saise,

Or the fair prospe& of {mmm-tal praise 3

Regard Ascanius, prince, the rosal boy3

The last, the best surviving hope of Troy 3 400
To whom the Fates decree, in time to come,

The long, long glories of imperial Rome.

He spoke, and speaking left him gazing there3

And all the fluid form difl'olv’d in air.

The prInce astonish’d stood, with horror stung3 405
Fear rais'd his hair, and wonder chain'd his tongue:
Struck and alasm’d with such a dread command,

He longs to leave the dear enchanting land.

But ah ! with what address ssmll he begin,

How speak his purpose to the raving queen? 410
A thousand thoughts his wavering soul divide, ’
-,Τὴ3ῐ turns each way, and strains on ev'ry fide:

A thousand projeE'cs labouring in his breast,

On this at last he fixes as the best: .

, Mnestheus and brave Cloanthus he commands 415
To rig the fimet, to summon all the hands

In secret filence to the shore, and hide

The sudden cause, that bids them tempt the tide.

Then while fair Dido, fick with fond defire,

Thinks such a boundless love can ne’er expire, 420
Himself the proper measures will prepare

To move the queen, and seize with watchful care }
The softest moments to address the fair.

With speed impatient fly thc chiefs away,
And fir’d with eager joy, the prince obcy. 425

fancy the pomp and solemnit'y of style too much humbled and

. depress'ed by it.

DiffertatIOn on ancient and modern learning.
