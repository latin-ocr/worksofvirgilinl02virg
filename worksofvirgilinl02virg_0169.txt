Book 2. THE AEmzn) οι·- Vmoxr„ 157

His peopled caves pour forth in open air

The heroes, and the whole imprison’d war.

Led .by the guiding cord, alight with joy

Th' impatient princes, in the midst of Troy3 350
Machaon first, then great Achilles' heir,

Ulysses, Thoas, Acamas, appear5

A crowd of chiefs with Menelaus succeed ;

Epeus last, who fram’d the fraudful steed.

Strait they invade the city, bury'd deep 355
In furnes of wine, and an diffolv’d in sseep3

They ssay the guards, they burst the gates, and join
Their fellows, conscious to the bold design-

'Twas now the time when first kind Heav'n bestews
On wretched man the bleffings of repose; 360
When, in my ssumbers, Hee’tor seem’d to rise,

A mournful vision ! to my closmg eyes.

Such he appeaffd, as when Achilles' car

And fiery coursers whirl’d him thro’ the war 3

Drawn thro’ his swelling feet the thongs I view’d‚ 365
’ His beauteous body black with dust and blood.

Ye gods ἕ how chang'd from Hedtor ἔ who with joy
Return'd in proud Achilles’ spoils to Troy;

flung at the ships, like Heav'n's almighty fire,

Flames aster flames, and wrapt a fleet in fire. 370
Now gafh’d with wounds that for his Troy he bore,

His beard and locks stood stiffen’d with his gore.

With tears and mournful accents I began,

And thus bcspoke the visionary man !

Say, glorious prince, thy country’s hope and joy, 375
What cause so long detains thee from thy Troy?

Say, from what realms, so long defir'd in vain,
Her Hecstor comes, to bless her eyes again ?

otherwise knew the death and destiny os Ιῖεέὶοτ. Such strokes,
not attended to by common readers, yshew a perfeEt' m fight into
human nature. Ἰ he poet himself has pointed out this beaucy
by the use of the word vana.
