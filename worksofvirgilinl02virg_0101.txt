Book 1. THE AENEJD 01²· VIRGIL. 89

Lest Dido, blind to fate, and ·Jove’s decree‚
Should {hut her ports, and drive them to the sea.
Swift on the steerage of his wings he flies,
And ssloots the vast expansxon of the sszies. 405
¹Arriv'd, th’ almighty's orders he pei-forms,
Charm’d by the god, no more the nation storms
With jealous tage 3 in chief the queen inclin’d
To peace, and mild benevolence of mind.
All night involv'd in cares AEneas lay, 410
But rose impatient at the dawn of day,
To view the coast, the country to explore,
And learn if men, or beasts poffess'd the shore,
(For wide around the gloomy waste extends)
And bear the tidings to‘his anxious friends. 415
Beneath a {helving rock his fieet dispos‘d,
With waving woods and aweful sslades inclos’d‚
Two glitt'ring spears he shook with martial pride,
And forth he rnarch’d ; Achates at his fide.
As thro' the wilds the chief his course pursu’d‚ 420
He meets his goddess-mother in the wood ς
In show, an huntress {he appear’d, array'd
In arms and habit like a Spartan maid3
Or swift Harpalyce of Thrace, whose speed
Out-flew the wings of winds, and tir‘d the rapid steed.
Bare was her knee3 and with an easy pride 426
Her polissi’d bow hung graceful at her fide.
Close‚ in a knot, her flowing robes she drew3
Loose to the winds her wauton treffes flcw.

426. Bare was her ἔπεα] This attitude is very graceful : Vir.
gil had in his eye a passage of Homer, where he makes Miner·
va appear to Ulyffes; but he has undoubtedly here excelled
the Greek poet. virgil took part-icular pleasurc wc may sup-
pose in describing his huntress; as well as AEneas's killing the
decr. Such objeas suited his rural taste.
