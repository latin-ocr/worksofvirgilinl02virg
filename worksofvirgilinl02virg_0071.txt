The fust verses of the Iliad are eminently splendid, and the
pr‹)p0¹iti0n of the AEneid closes with dignity and magnificence
not often to be found even in the poetry of virgil. The in·
tent of the imroduffion is to mise expeftation and suspend it;
something therefore must be discovered and something con-
cealed 2 the poet, while the fertility of his invention is yet un-
known, may properly recommend himself by the grace of his
language. He that reveals too much or promises too little, he
that never irritares the intelleelual appetite, or whoimmediately
satiates it, equally defeats his own purpose; and fince it is
neceffary to the pleasurc of the render, that few events should
be anticipated‚ by what can his attention be invited‚ but by
grandem· of expreffion P} No. 158.
