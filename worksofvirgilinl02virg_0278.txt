Lyffius Idomeneus : hic illa ducis Meliboei

Parva Philofftetae subnixa Petilia muro.

Qin, ubi transmissae steterint trans aequora claffes,

Et positis aris jam vota in litore solves,

Purpureo velare comas adopertus amiciti 3 405
Ne qua inter sanetos ignis in honore deorum

Hostius facies occurrat, et omina turbet.

Hunc socii morem sacrorum, hunc ipse teneto:

Hae casti maneant in religione nepotes.

Ast ubi digressum Siculae tc admoverit orae 410
Ventus, et angusti rarescent claustra Pelori ;

Laeva tibi tellus, et longo laeva petantur

Aequora circuitu ε dextrum fuge litus, et undas.

Haec loca vi quondam, et vasta convolsa ruina

(Tantum aevi longinqua valet mutare vetustas) 415
Diffiluiss'e ferunt ; curn protenus utraque tellus

Una foret : venit medio vi pontus, et undis

Hesperium Siculo latus abscidit, arvaque et urbis

Litore diductas angusto interluit aestu-

ς 38. Here Philmetes] Philoctetes was the son of Paean, and
the companion and friend of Hercules, who gave him in his last
moments the famous poisoned arrows; but Philoetetes being
unfortunately bit by a serpent in his font, the wound became
very offenfive to the camp, and the Grecian army thinking
the bite was a punilhment from the gods, agreed to send Phi-
lofietes into the solitary issand of Lemnos. But the oracle
afterwards declaring that Troy could not be taken without the
arrows of Hercules, he was brought back again by Ulyffes and
Neoptolemu53 and hearing, after Troy was taken, of an insur-
·refti0n or rather rebellion of the Meliboei, he came into Italy3
and either built, or fortified Petilia with walls. There is a
most beautiful tragedy of Sophocles on this simple subje& of
Philoctetes’s bving brought back to the Grecian army by
Ulysl'esz the substance and capital beauties of which have been
translated by Fenelon, and inserted into the fifteenth book of

· his Telemachus: the lamentations of Philoctetes in the latter

part of this tragedy, where he takes leave of his cave and so-
litary issand, are extremely poetica13 particularly, where he
wishes great birds would come to carry him away3 and where
he regrets the loss of his beloved bow. See ver. 1130. &
