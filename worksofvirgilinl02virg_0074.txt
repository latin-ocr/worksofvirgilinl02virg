of the causes of those quarrels and disgusts that animate Juno
against the Trojans‚ not one of them falls personally upon
AEneas. He is the object of this goddess's hatred only as he is
a Trojan. By this conda& the poet excites the compaffion of
his readers in favour of AEneas.

chinery in the very beginning of his poem3 the reason ofwhich,
and the use of machinery in general, was never better ex-
plained than lately, by Mr. Spence in his Polymetis; whose
observations I shall give at length, because they will serve to
illustrate a great number of passages in the AEneid.

“ The greatest of the ancient poets seem to have held, that
every thing in the moral as well as the natural world, was car-
ried on by the influence and direffion of the Supreme Being.
It was Jupiter· that astuated every thing, and in some sense

that a good cpic poet should always lay hold of this advantage,-
and ssiould carry on his whole astion, by the help of what we ,

introduced too freely, in a passage that is so often quoted, and
sometimes not quite to the purpose, he speaks only of the in-

troducing them too freely on the stage: for in epic poems, the ⁷

very best ofthe ancient p'oets‚ and the greatest patterns sor writ-
