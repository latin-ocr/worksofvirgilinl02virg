'Book 3. THE AENexn OF mer„

j-Buthelenus forbids to plow the ψῆνες
Where Scylla mars, and fieres Charybdis faves.

As death stands dreadful ’midst the dangerous road,

With backward course we piow the foamy flood 3

When, from Pelorus’ point a northern breeze

Swells every sau, and wafts us o'er the stas 3 ²

Fstst, where Pantagia' s n outh appear' d {11 v {ew⁹

Flank’ d bya range of rocks, the nax y θεν,

Τὶιεη, shooting by the farn’⁸ u Megarean bay ,

And lowly Tapsus cut the wat-ry way.

These coasts by Achaemenides were sstown,

Who foi low ’d, late, Laertes’ v *1:11 d’ rin ,ο son:

Familiar with the track he past n fore

He names the lands, and poin *ts out cv 'ry ss ore.
An isse, once call’ d Ortygia, fronts the fides

Of rough Plemmyrium, and Sicanian tides.

Hsther, 'tis said, Alphevs, fre-m his source

In Elis’ malms, dirmsts his watry course :

«Beneath the main he takes his secret way,

And mounts with Arethusa’s streams to day ε

Now a Siciliam flood his course he keeps,

And rolls with blended waters to the deeps.

Admonissm’d, I adore the gzzardian {3on

Then pass the bounds of rich Helorus’ floods.

Next our fleet gallies by Pachynus glide‚

Whose rpcks prrojed'ting stretch into the tide.

The Camarinian marsh I now surmy,

By fate forbidden 50 be drain'd away.

Then the Geloan fields with Gela came

In view, who bqrrow’d from the ssood their name.

With her huge wall proud Agragas succeeds 5
A realm, of old renown'd for gene-rous stecds.
