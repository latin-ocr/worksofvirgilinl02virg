Book 3. Tne AENmo or Vmon„ 261

My ssighted charnis to Helenus resign’d, 440
And in the bridal hands his capt vs‘z join'd.

But fierce Orestes, by the Furios rost

And mad with vengeance 1⁷01- the bride he lost,

⁷ - Swift on the monarch from his- ambusti {lex-v,

And at Apollo's hallow’d altar slew. 445

On Helenus devolv'd (the tyrant fiaiin)

A portion of the malm, a large domain :

From Chaon's name the fruitful tra& he calls,

And from old Pergamus, his growing walls.

But oh ! what winds, what fates, what gracious pow’rs,

Led you, unknowing, to these friendly ssiores ? 451

Does yet Ascanius live, the hope of Troy ?

Does his fond mother's death affii& the boy ?

Or glory’s charms his little foul infime,

To match my He&01·'s or his father’s fame ? ’ 455
So spoke the queen with mingled sobs and eries,

And tears in vain ran trickling from her eyes.

When lo l in royal pomp the king descends

With a long train, and owns his ancient friends.

Then to the town his welcome guests he led3 460

Tear follow'd tear, at ev'ry word he said.

Here in a foreign region I behold

A little Troy, an image of the old3

Here creeps along a poor penurious stream,

That fondly bears Scamander’s mighty name ε 465

458. <The king defiends] Boffu judicioussy observes, that the
reader of a poem is offended‚ when that is related to him which
he already perfec‘tly knows. This was not so great a fault in
Homer's time. Virgil is more exa& in this particular. Venus
in the first book would not hear AEneas make a recital of his
missortunes; she interrupts it to comfort him. And in the
third book, when good manners obliged AEneas to relate his
story to Andromache, Helenus comes ln very opportunely, and
so hindcrs him from going on with his discourse.
