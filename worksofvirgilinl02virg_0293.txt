Book 3. THE AEmzm oF Vmcu..

‚Them near the rocky Scylacaean bay

¹ For wrecks defam’d‚ we plow the watry way.
Now we behold, emerging to our eyes
From distant ssoede, Siciliam AEtna rise;
And hear a thund³ring din, and dreadful roar
Of billows breaking on the rocky shore.
The smoaking waves boil high, on every fide,
And,seoop the samis, and blacken all the tide.
Charybdis' gulph, my father eries, behold ἔ ‚
The direful rocks the royal seer foretold 3
By, piy your oars, and streteh to every stroke :
S'wift as the word, their ready oars they took3
first ikilful Palinure3 then all the train
Steer to the left, and plow the liquid plain.

Now ορ a tow'ring arch of waves we rise,

Heav'd on the bounding bsslows, to the fides,
Then, as ‘the⁴ roaring surge retreating fell,
We ssloot down head'long to the depths of hell.
Thrice the rough rocks rebellow in our ears 3

Thrice mount the foamy tides, and dass] the stars.

The wind now finking with the lamp of day,
Spent with her teile, and dubious of the way3
We reach the dire Cyclopem} shore, that forms
An ample port, impervious to the storms.

But sEtna roars with dreadful ruins nigh,

Now hurls a bursting cloud of cinders high,
Involnv’d in smoaky whirlwinds to the sky3
With loud dispioi'mn, to the starry frame
Shoots fiery globes‚ and furidus floods of flame:

Forth from whose nitrous caverns iffuing rise
Pure liquid fountains of tempestuous fire,
And veil in ruddy mists the neon-day ficies,

While wrapt in smoke the eddying flames aspire,

Or gleaming thro' the night with hideous roar

Thucydides, at the end of this third book, makes mention
