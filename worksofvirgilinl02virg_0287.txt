. Book 3. THE AENEm οι·- Vmon„

She gave my son a robe 3 the robe of old

Her own fair hands embroider'd o'er with gold ι

With precious vests she l‘oads the derling boy,

And a refulgent mande wrought in Troy.

Accept, dear youth, she said, these robes I wove

In happier days, memorial of rny love.

This trifling token of thy friend receive,

The last, last present Heeffoffls wife can give.

Ah ! now, meffiinks, and only now, I sce

My deas Astyanax revive in thee l

Such were his motions ! such a spi-ightly grace

Charm’d from his eyes, and open'd in his face!

And had- it pleas'd, alas l the pow’rs divine,

His blooming years had been the same as thine.
Thus then {he mournful last farewell Ι· took,

And, bath'd in team, the royal pair bcspoke:

Live you long happy in a settled state3

’Tis our's to wander still from fate to fate.

Safe have you gain’d the peaceful port of ease,

Not doom'd to plow th’ im‘neasurable seas 3

Nor feel< for Latium, that deludes the view,

A coast that flies as fast as we purfue.

Here you a new Scamander can enjoy 3

Here your own hands ere& a second Troy :

With happier omens may she rise in peace,

And less obnoxious than the first to Greece !

If e’cr the long—expec‘ied shore I gain,

Where Tyber's streams enrich the flow'ry plain 3

Or if I live to saise our fatcd town ;

Our Latini: Troy and yours ihall join in one3
