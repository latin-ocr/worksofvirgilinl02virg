Book ὲ. THE AEmsm OF Vmcn.. 291

Soon as the giant reach'd the deeper stood,
With many a grean he cleans'd the gathcr'd blood
From his b‘or’d eye-ball in the briny main,
And, bellowing5 grinds his teeth in agonizing pain. 900
Then stalks enormous through the midmost tides 3
And scarce the topmast surges reach his fides.
Aboard, the well-deserving Greek we took,
And, pale with fem, the dreadful coast fers00k5
Cut every cord with eager speed away, 995
Bend to the stroke, and sweep the foamy sea.
The giam: heard5 and, turning to the found,
At first pursu'd us through the vast profound3
Stretch’d his huge hand to reaeh the sscet in vain 3
Nor could he ford the deep Ionian main. 910
With that, the furious monster roar’d so lond,
That Ocean {hook in ev’ry distant fl00d3
Trembled all Italy from {hore to ss10re3
And AEtna’s winding caves rebellow to the roar.

Rouz'd at the peal, the fierce Cyclopian train 915
Rush’d from their woods and mountains to the main 3
Around the port the ghastly brethren stand,

A dire affembly ! covering all the strand.

I'n each grim forehead blaz’d the fingle eye 3

In vain enrag’d the monstrous race we spy, 9²0}
A host ofgiants tow'ring in the sky.

So on some mountain tow'rs the lofty grove

Of beauteous Dian, or imperial Jove3

The aerial pines in pointed spires from far,

Or spreading oaks, majestic nod in air. 925
Headlong we fly with horror, where the grzles

And spcedihg winds dire& the flutt’ring iniis.

la Motte used to say, that hc thought AEncns by far too great a
poet ; and thathc couid not help feeling thur impropriety thro’
the whole of the second and third beoks of the Aineid; where
the hero is often no less florrd and figurative in his narration,

than the poet himself is in the LrJest.
