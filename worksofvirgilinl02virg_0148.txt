nias says, that every one must either allow that this horse was
an engine made to batter the walls of Troy, or that the Trea
jans were most strangely infatuated. Tubero and Hyginus,
according to Servius on this passage, were likewise of opinion,
that it was such an engine as the ram or the testudo, invented
for the purpose mentioned by Pausanias, which Propertius
(says Mr. Merrie) seems to allude to when he says,

Aut quis equo pulsas abiegno nesccret arces ?

But that it was expressly the same as the battering ram is as-
serted only by the authority of Pliny, whose words are as fol-
lows: Equum, qui nunc Aries appellatur, in muralibus machinix.
Epeum ad *Trqjam in-veng'fflae dicunt. Lib. vii. c. 56. But no
historical authority can be produced that is reconcileable with
Pliny's affertion.

Though the original of this story of the Trojan horse be
thus uncertain, yet it can scarce be imagined that the fietion
could have been raised so early, and spread so universally,
without some foundation in history. Several therefore have
been inclined to believe the amount which is given of it by
Palaephatus, whose testimony carries with it the greater weight
on account of his antiquity, as he is thought to have lived
before Homer. It is reported, says this author, that the
Greeks took Troy, by enclofing themselves in a wcoden horse.
But the truth, of the story is, tlmt they built a horse of so large
a ἧκε, that it could not be drawn within the city wall& In
the mean while the chief of them lay concealed in a hollow
place near the city, which is to this day called Αργειων ηχος,
the Grecizm ambuscade. Sinon upon this deserted'to the Tro·
jans, and persuaded them to admit the horse within the city,
