Book 3. THE AENx-:m oF Vnmn„ 245

Swift shoots the fleet before the ,driving mast,
And on the Cretan shore descends at last'.
, With eager speed I frame a town, and call
From ancient Pergamus the rismg wall. 185
Pleas'd with the name, my Trojans I command
To raise strong tow’rs‚ and settle in the land.
Soon as our lusty youth the fleet could moor,
And draw the vessels on the sandy shore,
Some join the nuptia] hands : with busy toil 190
Their fellows plow the new-discover’d soil.
To frasne impartiet} Laws I bend my cares,
Allot the dwellings‚ and affign the [hares.
When lo ! from standing air and poison’d skies,
A sudden plague with dire contagion flies. 195
On corn and trees the dreadful pest began 3
And last the fierce infee‘fion seiz’d on man.
They breathe their souls in air; or drag with pain
Their lives, now lengthen'd out for woes, in vain ς
Their wonted food the blasted fields deny, 200
And the red {sog-star fires the sultry sky.
My fire advis'd, to measure back the main,
Consult‚ and beg the Delian god again
To end our woes, his suceour to display,
And to our wand'rings point the certain way. 205·
’Twas night 3 soft ssumbers had the world postest,
When, as I lay compos’d in pleasmg rest,
Those gods I bore from flaming Troy, asise
,1¹¹ awcful figures to my wond'ring eyes:
Close at my couch they stood² divinely bright‚ 210
And shone distin& by Cynthia's gleaming light,
Then, to dispel the cares that rack’d my breast,
These words the vifionary Pow’rs addrest z
Those truths the god in Delos would repeat,
By us, his envoys, he unfolds in Crete; 215
By us, companions of thy arms and thee,
From flaming Ilion o'er the swelling sea.
