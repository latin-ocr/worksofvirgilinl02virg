VIRGIL’S AENEID.
THE

SECOND BOOK.

’ LL gaz'd in filence, with an eager look3
Then from the golden core ²⁷ the hero spoke-

Ah mighty queen ἔ you urge me to difflose,
And feel, once more, unuttera'ok woes;
How vengeful Greeee with vio‘cory was crown’d, „j
And Troy's fair empire humbled to the ground ς
Those direful soenes I saw on Phrygia's shore,
Those wars in which so large a part I bore,

book is extremely beautifu1‚ and it is in general perhaps the
most corre& piece of the whole poem.

Ver. 1. Allgaz'd.] An ingenious critic hath lately made
some just observations on this second book: Let us conceive
an objeckor to put the following query: “ Suppofing the au-
thor of the AEneis to have related, in the natural order, the
destruffion of Tr0y3 would not the subje& have been, to all
intents and purposes‚ as much one, as it is, under its present
form3 in which that event is told, in the second book, by way
of episode ?'' Ianswer, by no means· The reason is taken
from the nature of the work, and from the state and expeRa-
tions of the render. , v

“ 1. The nature of an epic or narrative poem is'this, that it:
lays the author under an obligation 'of shewing any event,
which he formally undertakes in his own person, at full length,
and with all its material circumstances. Evcry figure must be

drawn in full proportion, algd exhibited in strong, glciwing
