Book 2. ¹ THE AENE'm OF V1R'G1L. ¹95

When, at the door, my weeping sponse I meet,
Thefair Creusa, who embracld my feet,
And clinging round them, with distra'ffion wild5
Reach'd to my arms my dear unhappy child : 910
And oh l {he eries, if bent on death thou run,
Take, take with thee, thy wretched wife and son ;
Or, if one glimmering hope from arms appear,-

Thus while {he faves, the v‘aulted dome replies·
To her loud ffirieks, and agonizin'g eries.-
When lo I a wond’rou's prodigy appears,
For while each parentkiss’d the boy with tearsj· 920

With beams refulgent round Inlus’ head 3

This once regard us with a gracious eye 5 9⁴30
If e’er our vows descrv'd thy 23¹ divine,
Vouchsafe thy succour, and confirm thy sign.

Fun on the left, the happy thunders roll 3
A star {hot fweeping through the {hades of night,- -935
' And drew behind a radient trail of light,

head of Serviu‘s Tullius, acco’rding to the relations of Pliny
an'd Plutarch, whilst he was yet an infant. It was conjectured
by that incident, that he would be a king. Anchises, (killed
in auguries‚ judged, by the same prognostic, that a kingdom
was promised to his grandson.
