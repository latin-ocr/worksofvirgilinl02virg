¹Book 4. . THE AENEm or Vmou. 355

Yet more—a temple, where she paid her vows, 665
Rose in the paiaee to her 'former spouse3

A marble struc‘ture 3 this {he dress’d around

With snowy wool3 with sacred chaplets crown'd.

From hence, when gloomy night succeeds the day,

Her husband seems to summon her away. 670
Perch'd in the roof the bird of night complains,

In one sad length of melancholy strains 3

Now dire predffi'cions rack her mind, foretold

By prescient fages, and the seers of o ¹3d

Now stern AEneaS‚ her eternal theme, 67 5
Haunts her distraeoed soul in ev’ry dream 3

In ssurnber now she seems to travel on,

Through dreary wilds, abandm'd and alone3

And treads a dark uncornfortable plain,

And seeks her Tyrians o'er the waste in vain. 680
So Pentheus rav’d, when, flaming to his eyes,

He saw the Furies from the deeps arise· 3 q

And view 'd a double Thebes with wild amne,

And two bright suns With rival glories blaze

So bounds the mad Orestes o' er the stage, 685
With looks distraeted, from his mother’s rage3

Arm'd with her scourge of snakes [he drives him on,
And, wrapt in flames, pursues hei· murdering son3

He mes, but flies in. vain 3--the Furios wait,

And fiends in forms tremezidous guard the gate. 690

A circumstance follows, which is most wo: derfulxy moviug,
and which none of the critics (not even P. Brumoy) has
taken any notice of. Orestes is hc ld doun upon a conch by
his fond sister Ele metra pi cer cd wit h gris to {ee him in tha‘t
distrafted condition, and he mistakcs lic-r in his madness for
one of his tormentors, ὰ eries out; ‘Away, thou art one
of my Furies, that perpetiully haunt me, uho hast now
gralped me r< und my middle, that thou mayst hurl me down
into hell.'' The Greek is inimitable.
