Book ζμ THE AEmzm or Vraom. 323

Be mine the care, th’ imperial dame replies,
To gain the god, the sovereign of the sszies.
Then heed my counsel-when the dawning light
Drives from the opening world the shades of night ;
The prince and queen, transfix’d with amorous flame,
Bend to the woods to hunt the sav-age game ε 181
There, while the crowds the forest-walks beset,
Swarm round the woods, and spread the waving net;

In storms of hail, and deluges of rain: 185

And the long thunders roar from pole to pole.
On ev‘ry fide shall fly the scattering crowds,
Involv'd and cover’d in a night of clouds.
To the same cave for shelter shall repair 190

Ourself in Hymen's nuptial hands will join.

And rear’d above the waves her radiant head,
When, pouring through the gates, the train appear,

The Tyrian pcers before the regal gnte.
Her steed, with gold and purple cover’d round,
Neighs, champs the bit, and foaming pnws the ground·
At length st1e comeS, magnificently dre-st 205

Back in a golden caul her locks arc ty'd;
A golden quiver rattlcs at her fidc3
A golden clasp her purple garments binus,
And robes, that flew redundant in the winds. 210
