” Book 3. THE AENEm or Vmon„ 251

But fiends to scourge mankind, so fierce, so fell,
Heav’n never summon'd from the depths of he113
Bloated and gorg'd with prey, with wombs obscene, 290
Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean3
A virgin face, with wings and hooky claw83
Death in their eyes, and famine in their jawS.

The port we enter'd, and with joy beheld
Huge herds of oxen graze the verdant field, 295
And feeding flocks of goats, without a swain,
That range at large, and bound along the plain5
We seim, we ssay, and to the copious feast
Call every god, and Jove himself a guest.
Then on the winding shore the tables plac’d, 3οφ
And sate indulging in the rich repast3 μ’
When from the mountains, terrible to view,
On founding wings the monster Harpyes flew,
They taint the banquet with their touch abhorr’d,
Or snatch the smoking viands from the board. 305
A stench offensive follows where they fly,
And loud they feteam, and raise a dreadful cry.
Thence to a cavern'd rock the train remove,
A'sxd the close shelter of a ssiady grove.
Once more prepare the feast, the tables raise ; 310
Once more with fires the loaded altars blaze.
Again the fiends from their dark covert fly,
But from a different quarter of the ss<y;
With loathsome'claws they snatch the food away,
Scream o'er our hemis, and poison all the prey. 315
Enrag’d‚ I bid my train their arms prepare,
And with the direful monsters wage the war.

'3⁰¹'ng such an absurdity, by telling us, that it was an ancient
tra mon:

Prisca fides sablo, fidsama perennis.

It seems that Virgil, afhamed of such a fairy tale, hath a mind
to excuse it by the common belief.

Many paffagcs in Virgil considered in this vie-V, are entirely
· vindicated against his crines, whose good sense was misscd in
that particular, by their inattention.
