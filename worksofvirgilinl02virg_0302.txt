290 P. VIRGILH MARoms ΑΕΝΕῙε. Lib. 3.

Postquam altos tetigit fluetus, et ad aequora venit,
Luminis effoffi fluidum lavit inde cruorem,

Dentibus infrendens gemitu: graditurque per aequor
Jam mdiu-m, necdum studius latera ardua tinxit. 665
Nos trepidi procul inde fugam celerare, recepto
Supplice, s1c merit03 tacitique incidere funem3
Verrimus et proni certantibus aequora remis.

Sensit, et ad sonitum vocis vestigia torsit.

Verum ubi nulla datur dextram adfectare potestas, 670
Nec potis Ionios fluctus aequare sequend03

Clamwrem inmensum tollit ; quo pontus, et omnes
Intremuere undae, penitusque exterrita tellus

Italiae, curvisque immugiit Aetna cavernis :

At genus e silvis Cyclopum et montibus altis 675
Exeitum ruit ad portus, et litora conplent.

Cernimus adstantis nequidquam lumine torvo

Aetnaeos fratres, caelo capita alta ferentis,

Concilium horrendum : quales cum vertice celso

Aer-iae quercu3, aut coniferae cyparissi 680
Constiterunt2. filva alta Jovis, lucusve Dianae.

Praecipites metus acer agit quocumque rudentis
Excutere9 et ventis intendere vela secund-is.

sedare, in the original, has given the commentatore much
fruitless trouble to endeavour to make sense 0f; though all the
transsators agree in the meaning of the words, yet there is a pe-
culiarity in the phrase, which, for wan: of a parallel expression
in any Other claffic author, has never been sufficiently cleared
up. The reading proposed by the Cambridge editor of dex-
tram anyeflare, if it were supported by any copies„ as it is not,
would oe equally unaccountable.

912. Tbat Oceanfhcck] This is a most noble hyperbole, and
by no means too bold, as some will have it3 they forget not
only the prerogativa: ofpoetry‚ but the real nature of fear;
which always swells and heightens its objee't. TRAPP.

922. So onsome maantam] It is observable that this very {hort
simile is the only onein the third book. For my own part, Ι
could wilh there had been none longer than this, in the second.
It wazon the fiabje& of long, labour'd compensem, that M. de
