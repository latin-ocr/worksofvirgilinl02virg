Eripui (fateor) leto me, et vincula rupi :

Limosoque lacu per noctem obscurus in ulva 135
Delitui, dum vela darent, si forte dedissent.

Nec mihijam patriam antiquam spes ulla videndi,

passages I ever met with. Vir-gil, to shew the triumph of his
art, will sosten us with the render-cst compassion by the mouth
of one whom we know to ‘be a perjur’d villain. It is not in-
deed upon the account οἱ him, but cf human nature in ge-
