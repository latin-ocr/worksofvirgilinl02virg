B‘Iyrmidonum, Dolopumve, aut duri miles Ulixi
Temperet a lacrimis l et jam nox humida caelo

Sed, s1 tantus amor casus cognoscere nostros, ιο

Quamquam animus meminisse horret, luetuque refugit3

colours. Now had the subject of the second book of the
AEneis been related, in this extent, it must not only have
taken up one, but many books. By this faithful and animated
drawing, and from the time it must necessarily have to play
upon the imagination‚ the event would have grown into such
importance‚ that the remainder could only have passed for a
kind c'f appendix to it.

but coming from the mouth of a person, necessarily engaged
in the progress os the aetion, it serves for a short time to in-

from the point of viem yet not long enough to destroy that
impatient curiosity, which looks sarward to it. And thus
it contributes to the same end, :is a piece of miniatum, pro-
perly introduced into a large pisiture. It amuses the eye with
iomething relative to the paimei-'s design, yet not so, as to
withhold its principa] observatiou from falling on the greater
subjeft. The parallel will not *hold very exactly, because the
pain-ter is, of necessity, confined to the same instant of time3
