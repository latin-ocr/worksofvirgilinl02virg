Book 1. Tm AEN'Em OF Vmcu. 69

Night hovers o’er the floods; the day retire33 120
The heav'ns flaffi thick with momentary fires;
Loud thunders ffiake the poles; from ev’ry place
Grim death appear'd‚ and glar'd in ev’ry face.
In horror fix’d the Trojan hero stands.
He grows, and spreads to heav'n his lifted hands. 125
Thrice happy those ! whose fate it was to fall
(Exclaims the chief) beneath the Trojan wall·
Oh ! 'twas a glorious fate to die in sight,
Το die, so bravely, in their parents' fight!
Oh! had I there, beneath Tydides' hand, 130'
That bravest hero of the Grecian band,
Pour’d out this foul, with martial glory fir’d, ⁴
And in that field triumphantly expir’d‚
‘VVhere Hector fell by fierce Achilles' spear,
And great Sarpedon, the renown’d in war3 135
WVhere Simois‘ streams, incumber’d with the siaiu,
Roll'd ffiields, and helms, and heroes to the main.
