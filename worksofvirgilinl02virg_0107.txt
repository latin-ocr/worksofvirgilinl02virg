Book 1. THE‘AENEm oF V1R011..

By Grecian foes expell’d from Troy we came,
From ancient Troy (if e'er you heard the name)
Thro' various seas3 when lo ἔ a tempest roars,
And raging drives us on the Libyan shores.
'The good AENEAs am I call'd3 my fame,
And brave exploits‚ have reach'd the starry frame:
From Grecian flames I bear my rescu’d gods,
Safe in my vessels, o'er the stormy floods.
In search of ancient Italy I rove,
And draw my lineage from almighty Jove.
A goddess-mother and the fares, my guides,
With twenty ships I plough'd the Phrygian tides,
Scarce sev’n of all my fleet are left behind,
Rent by the waves, and shatter’d by the wind.
Myself, from Europe and from Asia cast,
A helpless stranger rove the Libyan waste.

No more could Venus hear her son bewail
His various woes‚ but interrupts his tale.
VVhoe’er you are, arriv'd in these abodes,
No wretch I deem abandon'd by the gods ;

Hence then, with haste, to yon' proud palace bend

Your course, and on the gracious queen attend.

Your friends are safe, the winds are chzmg’d again,

Or all my skill in augury is vain!

“ See those twelve swam, a flock triumphant, fly,
Whom Iately ffiooting from th' etherial sky, ¹
Th’ imperial bird of Jove dispers’d around‚
Some hov’ring o’er, some settling on the ground.
As these returning clap their founding wings,
Ride round thc fides, and sport in airy ring83

So have your friends and ships posscss'd the« strand,
Or with full-bellying sails approach the land.
Haste to the palace then, without dclay,

And, as this path disens, pursue your way.
