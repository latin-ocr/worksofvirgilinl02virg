¹Book 1. THE AEmzm or VIRGIL· 71'

Thus while he mourns, the Northern blast prevails‚
Breaks all his ears, and rends·his flying sails3
The prow turns round ; the galley leaves her fide 140
Bare to the working waves‚ and roaring tide3
While in huge hetzps the gathering surges spread,
And hang in wat'ry mountains o'er his head.
These ride on waves sublime 3 those ee the ground
Low in the boiling deeps, and dark profound. 145
Three ssiatter’d gallies the strong Southern- blast
On hidden rocks, with dreadful fury, cast-3
Th’ Italians call them altars, as they stood
Sublime, and heav'd their backs above the flooda.
Three more, fierce Eurus on the Syrtes threw f 150
From the main sea, and (terrible to view)
He dash'd‚ and left the vessels, on the land,
Intrench’d with mountains of surrounding sand.
Struck by a billow, in the -hero’s view,
From prow to stern the ssiatter’d galley ssew 155}
Which bore Orontes, and the Lycian erew τ
Swept off the deck, the pilot from the skip,
Stunn'd by the stroke, shot headlong down the deep:
The veffel‚ by the surge tost round and round,
Sunk, in the whirling guis devour’d and drown’d. 160
Some from the dark abyss emerge again5
Arms, planks, and treasureS, ssoat along the main„
And now thy ship, Ilioneus, gives way,
Nor thine‚ Achates, can refist the sea· 3
Nor old Alethe s his stgron · galle) save33165
Then Abas yields to the &orions waves:
The storm dissolves their well-compa&cd fides,
Which drink at many a lcak the hostile tides.

Mean time th’ imperial monarch of the main
Heard the loud tumults in his wat'ry reign, ¹7⁶
And saw the furious tcmpest wide around
Work up the watcrs from the vast profound.
