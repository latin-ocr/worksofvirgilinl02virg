Book 1, Tm. AENEm 01- V1RG11.. 67

VVhom thus the queen address’d : Since mighty Jove,
The king of men, and fire of gods above,
Gives thee, grear AEolus‚ the pow'r to raise 90
Storms at thy sovereign will, or smooth the scas,
A race, I long have labour'd to destroy,
Waft to Hesperia the remains of Troy.
Ev’n now their navy cuts the Tuscan floods,
Charg’d wlth their exiles, and their vanquiih’d gods. 95
Wing all thy fut-{nug vinds ; 0⁷erwhelm the train,

DispersC, or plung2 meir vessels iu the main.

For thy reward the fairest {⁷11 rdign, [mine3
The charming Deiopeia [hall be thlrm3 100

And make thee father of a raee like her.

The talk, and mine to listen and obey.

And share the graees and the smiles of Jove:

By you, these realms, this scepter I mahnain,

And wear these honours of the stormy reign.

So spoke th' obsequious god, and, while he spoke,
Whirl'd his vast spear, and piere’d the hollow rock. 110
The winds, emhattled‚ as the mountain rent,

Flew all at once impetuous thro’ the vent3

Raab, in their course, with giddy whirls they sweep,
Ruth to the seas, and bare the bosom of the deep:
East, West, and South, all blaek with tempestS, roas,

And roll vast billows to the trembling shore, 116
The cordage cracks 3 with unavailing eries

The Troja‘ns mourn3 while sudden clouds asise, }
And raviss1 from their fight the splendore of the sszies.

both that and this were originally copied from Appollonius
Rhodius, Β. 2. Juvenal seems to ridicule their overcharging
their pieces ; where speaking of a real storm, he says 'twas as
bed as a poetical one. Sat. xxii. 24· Sennea,
