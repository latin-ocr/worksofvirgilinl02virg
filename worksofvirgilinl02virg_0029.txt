DISSERTATION. 17

haps not so often as certain chimerical critics imagine.
I cannot help thinking this beauty was defigned to be ob-
served in the following lines among many others :

Radit iter liquidum, celeres neque commovet alas.

Et magnos membrorum artus, magna qffa lacertosque.
Ut quondam in Iustis aut culminibus desertis.

Ferte citi flammas, date vela, impellite remos.

Cornua velatarum obvertimus antennarum.
>Telum imbelle stne ieta.

 

And many more instances, which could not happen by
accident, may 'ne seen in the third book of Vida’s poenes,
and in Clarke's notes on the Iliad, and in the Actius of
Pomanus.

There remains to be mentioned Virgil’s distinguilhing
beauty and charaeteristical excellence, his exquisite and
expreffive brevity. He never inserts a syllable in vain.
He is close and prest. He gives us more things than
words, but without abruptness or obscurity. He never
exhausts the subje&‚ by saying all upon it that could be*
said, but leaves something for the mind of the reader to
discover. To him may we justly apply the elegant eu-
logium which Pliny gives Timanthes, one of the most ad·-
mirable painters of Greece, in the xth chap. of the 35th
book: Timanthi plurimum adfuit ingenii in omnibus operi·-
bus ejus; intelligitur enim plus semper quam pingitur.
“ Timanthes displaycd a great genius in all his pieces,
his meaning always is much fuller than his expreffion.”

From this short view of the Aeneid it may appear, that
the plan of it is formed upon pious resignation and its
rewards, as the plan of the Iliad is, upon anger and its
pernicious effetas. Consequently lEneas is a more ami-
able and virtuous charac‘tcr than Achilles, whom Homer
never designcd as a perfect hero, or as a proper objmf'c of
imitation. The intent-ion and scope of the Iliad is so
plainly pointed out by Horace in his 'epistle to Lollius,
