'Book 3. Tne AEmzm or Vnica. 237

Ill-fated Priam, when the Grecian pow'rs

With a close siege begirt the Dardan tow’rs‚

No more confiding in the strength of Troy,

Sent to the Thracian prince the hapless boy, 63
With mighty treasures, to support him there,

Remov'd from all the dangers of the war.

This wretch‚ when Ilion's better fortunes cease‚

Clos'd with the proud vietorious arms of Greece 3

Broke thro’ all sacred laves, and uncontroll'd- 70
‘Destroy’d his royal charge, to seize the‘gold.„

Curs'd gold l—how high will daring mortals rise

In ev’ry guist, to reach the glittering prize?

Soon as my soul recover’d from her fears,
“Before my father, and thetgather’d peers‚ 75·
I lay the dreadful omens of the gods 3

All vote at once to fly the dire abodes 3

To leave th' unhospitable realm behind,

And spread our op’ning canvas to the wind.

But first we paid the rites to Polydore, 80
And rais'd a mighty tomb arnid the shore.

Next‚ to his ghost, adorn'd with cypress boughs,

And sable wreaths, two solemn altars rose ;

With lamentable eries, and hair unbound,

The Trojan dames in order mov'd around. 85
Warm milk and sacred blood in bowls we brought,

To lure the spirit with the mingled draught3

and see what we ourselves would say on such and such an occasion.
By this means a man will learn to use sentences seldomer, and to
retrench those that being not necessary to raise the idea of what
he would represent, are only dress’d up for a show. He will
likewise learn to strip a great many thoughts of that pompous
air, which forms a general precept out of a trifle. And he will
say upon these occalion3; Ι command you to speak; do you
obcy: and not, like Seneca, He who does not speak when
commanded, does not do as we commanded him. Some mo·
dem writers that may be named, might profit if they considered
this Remarl:‚ especially the generality ofour tragedy writers.
