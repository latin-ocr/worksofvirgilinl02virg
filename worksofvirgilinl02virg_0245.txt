Book 3. THE AEm-:m or Vnica. 233

Doubtful‚ where Heav’n would fix our wand’ring train,
Our gather’d pow'rs prepare to plow the main. ιο
Scarce had the summer {hot a genial ray;
My sare commands the canvas to display,
And steer wherever Face ssmuld point the way·
With τεαῖς 1 leave the port, my native shore,
And those deas fields, where Ilion rose before. 23
An exil’d xvretch, I lead into the floods
My son, my friends, and all my vanquish’d gods,
The warlike Thracians till a boundless plain,
sacred to Mars, Lycurgus’ ancient reign3
Ally'd to Troy, while fortune own’d her cause ; 20
The same their gods and hospitable laws3
Thither,with faces averse, my courseI bore,
And rais'd a town amid the winding shore.
Then from my name the rismg city call,
And stretch along the strand th’ embattled wall. 25
Here to my mother, and the favouring gods,
I offer’d vicffims by the rolling floods ε
But ssew a state1y bull to mighty Jove,
Who reigns the sovereign of the pow’rs above.
Rais'd on a mount, a cornel grove was nigh, 30
And with thick branches stood a myrtle by.
With verdant boughs to shade my altars round,
I carne, and try’d to rend them from the ground.
When lo ! a horrid prodigy I see 3
For scarce my hands had wrench’d the rooted tree, 35

But this was not done to make us stare. He is, as we observe,
in a legissative capacity, and writes to poffess the people of tho
interpofition of the gods, in omens and prodigies3 which was
in the method ofthe old lawgivers. So Plutarch tells us, that
with divinations and omens, Lycurgus sanffified the Lacede·
moniam, Numa the Romam, lon the Athenians, and Deuca-
lion all the Greeks in general; and by hopes and fears kept up
in them the awe and reverence of religion. The scene of this
adventure is laid, with the utmost propriety‚ on the uncivilized
inhospitable shores of Thrace, to inspire horror for barbaroua
manners, and an inclination and appetite for civil olicy.” τ
