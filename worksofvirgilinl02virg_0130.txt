Omni< in Ascanio cari stat cura parentis.

Munera practerea, Iliacis erepta ruinis,

Ferre jubet ; pallam signis auroque rigentem,

Et circumtextum croceo velamen acantho,

Ornatus Argivae Helenae : quos illa Mycenis, 650
Pergama cum peteret, inconcessosque Hymenaeos,
Ennii-rat, matris Ledae mirabile donum.

Praeterea sceptrum, Ilione quod gesserat olim,

Maxima gnatarum Priami, colloque monile

Bac-catum, et duplicem gemmis auroque coronam. 655
Haec celerans, iter ad navis tendebat Achates.

At Cytherea novas artis, nova pectore versat

Consilia: ut faciem mutatus et‘ora Cupido

Pro dulci Ascanio veniat, donisque furentem

Inccndat reginam, atque offibus inplicet ignem. 660
Quippe domum timet ambiguam, Tyriosque bilinguis.
Urit atrox Juno, et sub noetem cura recursat. ” ”
Ergo his aligerum dietis adfatur Amorem :

Gnate, meae vires, mea magna potentia, solus,

Gnate, patris summi qui tela Typhoea temnis; 665
Ad te confugio, et supplex tua numina posco,

Frater ut Aeneas pelago tuus omnia circum
Litorajaftetur, odiis junonis iniquae,

874. *Fa1'r Helen’s dreſs] Our hero’s presents to Dido are all
(hose-n with great elegance and propriety. And there is even
something of gallantry in sending her a robe formerly worn by
the beautiful Helen, and the sceptre of Ilione.

884. But beauteous Venus.] “ That the chief divinity who
guides the hely, wife, and brave AEneas, should be Venus, is
somewhat unlucky. She well might tutor Paris, and favour all
the Trojans, who had their seraglio's even then3 but it required
great discretiori to make her a& in the AEneid with any propri-
εἰς. And after all, however we may be charmed with the de-
licacy of her appearance, and the pomp of the description, I
don't know but ssie is introduced as a mere person, divine in-
deed, and of great power; but without any regardto her cha-
racter and inclinations. It was hard to make her appear in a
νιτῑυοιτῆ cause, or dire& the enterprizes of the pious hero, in
any uther capacity thau his traditional parent3 except she had
