Of the CHARACTERS.

' Ν a well-disposed pienum, it is not required that every

figure should be represented with an equal degree of
strength and eminence. The principal figure must be
brought nearer the eye, drawn at full length, and be
completely viewed, as far as the mles of perspetfftive and
proportion will admit. There will be other personages,
which it will be neceffary to place in almost as strong a
light as that of the principal one. Some figures must be
half hid3 others must appear more or less entire, as the
grouping requires, In representing a croud, or great
number of persons together, the extreme parts only
should be distinguiffied, and, in short, so much express-

nearer figures fignify by their attitude, countcnancc,
titles, or other external marks, their proper charaetcr,
