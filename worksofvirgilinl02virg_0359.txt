Perfidious monster ! boast thy birth no more3 525
No hero got thee, and no goddess bore. v
No l--thou wert brought by Scythiam rocks to day,
By tigers nurs’d‚ and savages of prey3
But fur more rugged, wild, and fierce than they. }

For why, ah ! why the traitox· should Ι spare ? 530
What bafer wrongs can I be doom'd to bear ?

Did he once deign to turn ‘nis scornful eyes?

Did he once groan at all my piercing fighs ?

Dropp'd he one tear in pity to my eries?

Calm he look’d on, and saw my paffion burst. 535
Which, which of all his insults was the worst?

And yet great Jove and Juno from the sky

Behold his treason with a careless eye;

Guilt, guile prevails 3 and justice is no more.

The needy wretch just cast upon my ffiore, 540
Fool as I was ! with open arms Ι led v Δ
At once α partner to my throne and bed;

From instant dearh Ι sav³d his famish’d train,

His shatter'd fleet Ι stor'd and rigg’d again.

But ah I rave 3—-my foul the furies ἦγες 545
Now ἐπὶ-’.ἵ Apollo warns him to retire 3

Vffith all his oracles forbids to {lay 3

And now through air with haste the son of May
Conveys Jove's orders from t'ne blest 2¹30ch 3

·' A care well worthy to disto-rb the god< l 550
Go them Ι plead not, nor thy ssight dahty5

Go, seek new kingdoms through the watry way:

But there may every-god, thy crime provokes,

· Reward thy guilt, and dash thee on the rocks;

Then {halt thou call, amid the howling main, 553
On lnjur’d Dido's name, nor call in vuin;

For, wrapt in fircs, I’ll follow through the sky,

ἲς Flash in thy face, or glare tremendous by.

When death’s cold hand my struggling foul sslall free,

[- My ghost in every place shall wait on thee3 560
