Book 2. THE AENmD 01·- Vmon„ ¹59

After such numbers ssain, such labours past,
Thus is our prince l ah ! thus return'd at last? 380
Why stream these wounds ? 'or who could thus disgraee
The manly charms of that majestic face ?
Nought to these questions vain the shade replies,
But from his bosom draws a length of fighs 3
Fly, fly, oh ! fly the gathering flames3 the walls 385
Are won by Greece‚ and glorious Ilion falls5
Enough to Priam and to Troy before
Vv⁷as paid3 then strive with destiny no more3
Could any mortal hand prevent our fate,
This hand, and this alone, had sav'd the state. 390
Troy to thy care commends her wand'ring gods 3
With these pursue thy fortunes o'er the floods
To that proud city, thou shalt raise at last,
Return’d from wand’ring wide the watry waste.
This said,‘' he brought from Vesta's hallow’d quire 395
The sacred wreaths‚ and everlasting fire.
Nleantime tumultuous round the walls arise
Shrieks, clamours‚ shouts, and mingle in the sszies.
And (tho' remote my father's palace stood,
With shades surrounded, and a gloomy wood) 400
Near, and more near, approach the dire alarms :
'The voice of woe3 the dreadful din of arms.
Rous'd at the deaf'ning peal that roars around‚
I mount the dome, and listen to the found.
Thus o'er the corn, while furious winds conspire, 405
Rolls on a wide-devouring blaze of fire3
Or some big torrent, from a mountain's brow,
Bmsts, pours, and thunders down the vale below,

of five or fix lines about a fire seizing a field ofcorn‚ or a {hep—
herd listening to the roarings ofa torrent? In short, I think all
the ssmiles AEneas uses in this second and the third book, dur-
ing the time he is relating his story and adventures to Dido, are
as injudicious and as ill placed as those laboured comparisons are
with which the atks of several celebrated modern tragedies are
concludcd.
