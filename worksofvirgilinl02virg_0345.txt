Book 4. THE AENEm or Vmcn..

Or do we vainly tremble and adore,
When thro* the ss<ies the pealing thunders roar ἓ
Thine are the bolts ? or idly do they fall,
And rattle thro’ the dark aerial hall ?
A wand'ring woman, who on Libya thrown‚
Rais’d on a purchas'd spot a ssender town ;
On terms ourself prescrib’d, was glad to gain
A barren tra& that runs along the main 3 Ι
The proffer’d nuptials of thy son abhorr’d ;
But to her throne receives a Dardan lord.
And lo I this second Paris come again,
With his unmmly, soft‚ luxurious train,
In scented treffes and a mitre gay,
To bear my bride, his ravish’d prize‚ away3
While still in vain we bid thy altars flame,
And pay our vows to nothing but a name.
Hirri, as he grasp'd his altars, and prefer’d
His wrathful pray'r‚ th' almighty father heard3
Then to the palace turn'd his aweful eye,
Where, careless of their farne, the lovers lie.
The god, that scene offended to survey,

Charg'd with his high command the son of May:

Fly, fly, my son, our orders to perform ;

¹ Mount the fleet wind, and ride the rapid storm ;
Fly-to yon Dardan chief in Carthage bear
Our aweful mandate through the fields of air,
Who idly ling’ring in the Tyrian state,
Negie&s the promis’d walls decreed by fate.
Not such a prince, the beautcous queen of love

(When twice she sav’d him) promis'd him to Jove;

A prince she promis'd who by deeds divine

should prove he sprung from Teucer’s martial line ς

Whose sword imperial Italy should awe,

A warlike realm ! and give the world the law.
If no such glories can his mind inflame,

⁴If he neglec‘ts his own immortal fame5
