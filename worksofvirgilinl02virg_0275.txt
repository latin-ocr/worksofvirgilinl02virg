Book 3. THE AENEm OF VIRGIL. 263

A second Scaean gate I clasp with joy,
In dear remem-brance of the first in Troy.
With me, the ‘monarch bids my friends, and all,
Indulge the banquet in the regal hall,
Crown'd with rich wine the foamy goblets hold 3 470
And the vast feast was serv'd in massy gold.

Two days were past, and now the southern gales
Call us aboard, and stretch the swelling sails.
A thousand doubts distra& my anxious breast,
And thus the royal prophet I address’d: 475
Oh sacred prince of Troy, to whom ’tis giv’n,
To speak events, and search the will of Heav’n,
The secret mind of Phoebus to declare
From munds, fflpods, and from every star t
To know the voice of every fowl that flieS, 480
The figns os every wing that beats the skie53
Instruc'l: mc, sacred seer, since every god,
With each blest omen, bids me plow t‘he fl00d‚
To reach fair Italy, and measure o’er
A length os ocean to the destin’d shore ε 485
The Harpy queen, and ssie alone, relates
A scene of sad unutterable fames,
A dreadful famine sent from heaven on high,
With all the gather’d vengeance of the sky ;
Tell me, what dangers I must first oppose, 490
And how o'ercome the mighty weight of woes-

Now, the due vielims ssain, the king implores
The grace and favour of th’ immortal pow'rs 3
Unbinds the fillets from his sacred head,
Then, by the hand, in solemn state he led 495
His trembling guest to Phoebus’ fair abode,
struck with an aweful reverence of the god.
At length, with all the sacred fury fir’d,
Thus spoke the prophet, as the god inspir'd :
