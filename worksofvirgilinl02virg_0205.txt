Primis, servants5 all, intreat him to be gone,
Nor to the general ruin add his own3
Bid him be reconcil’d to life once more,> 875
Nor urge a fate3 that ssew too swift before.
Unmov'd3 he still determines to maintain
His ciuel purpose‚· and we plead in vain.>
Α Once morev I hurry to the dire alaz-mg
To end a miserable life in arms 3 . 88¹0
For oh ! what measures could I now pul-sue,¹
When death, and only death, was left in view:
To fly the foe, and leave your age alone,
Could such a sire propose to such a son ?
If 'tis by your's and Heav'n's high will deeroed, 885
That you, and all, with hapless Troy, must bleed3
If not her least remains you deign to save5
Behold l the door lies open to the grave,
Pyrrhus will soon he here, all cover'd 0³e1⁴
And red from venerable Priam's gore; 890
Who stab'd the son before thetfather's view,
Then at the shrine the royal father ssew.
Why, heavenly mother! did thy guardian care
§natch me from fires, and {hield me in the war?
Within these walls to see the Grecians roam, 895
And purple ssaughter stride around the dome;
To see my murder’d confort, son⁷ and fire,
Steep in each other’s blood, on heaps expirel ι
Arms ! arms'! my friends, with speed my arms supply&
'Tis our* last hour, and summons us to die3' Ι 900
My 'arms !-—In vain you h'old me,—let me go—
Give‚ give me back this moment to t'he foe.
’Tis well—we will not tamely perish all,
But die reveng’d, and triumph in our fall.
Now rushing forth, in radiant arms, I wield 905

The fword once more, and gripe the pond’rous shicld÷

Myself‚ my shrieking wife, my weeping son, }
