Book 1. THE AENEm οε V1Ro11..

Belum, the fates may baffie Juno's aims 3

And why could Pallas, with avenging flames,
Burn a whole navy of the Grecian ships,

And wheim the scatter’d Argives in the deeps ?
She, for the crime of Ajax, from above
Launch'd thro' the clouds the fiery bolts of Jove3
Dash’d wide his sseet, and3 as her tempest ssew,
Expos’d the ocean's int-nost depths to view.

Thon, while transfix'd the blasted wretch expires
Flames from his breast, and fires succeeding sires,
Smteh'd in a whirlwind‚ with a sudden shock,
She hurl'd him headlong on a pointed rock.

But I, who move supreme in heaven’s amodes,
Jove's fister-wife, and empress of the gods,
With this one nation must a war maintain

For years on years 3 and wage that war in vain ἲ
And now what suppliants will invoke my name,
Adore my pow’r, or bid my altars flame ?

Thus fir’d with rage and vengeance, now {he flies
To dark AEolia‚ from the distant fides,
Impregnated with storm53 whose tyrant binds
The blust’ring tempests, and relmstant winds-
Thcir rage imperial AEolus restrains
With rocky dungeons, and enormous chains.
The bellowing brethren‚ in the mountain pent,
Roar round the cave, and struggle for a vent.
From his high throne, their fury to assuage,

He shakes his sceptre, and controuls their rago ;

Or down the void their rapid whirls had driv’n
Barth, air, and ocean, and the tow'rs of heaven.
But Jove, the mighty ruin to prevent,

In gloomy caves th' aerial captives pcnt3 ,·

O'er their wild fage the pond'rous rocks he spread,
And hurl’d huge hcaps of mountains on their head 3
And gave a king, commiffion'd to restrain

And curb the tempesb or to loose the rein.
