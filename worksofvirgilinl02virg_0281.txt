3001< 3, Tne AENEm OF VIRGIL. 259

Fierce to the right tremendous Scylla roars,
'‘ Charybdis on the left the flood devours :
Thrice swallow’d in her womb‚ subfides the sea,
Deep, deep as hell 3 and thrice {hespouts away 565
From her black bellowing gulphs‚ disgorg'd on high,
³ 'VVaves after waves, that dash the distant sky.
ἱ Lodg‘d in a darksom cavern’s dreadful shade,
ἶ High o’er the surges Scylla rears her head ;
“ Grac'd with a virgin’s breast, and female looks, 570
J She draws the vessels on the pointed rocks.
'‘- Belo-w, {he lengthens in a monstrous whale,
ζ.. With dogs surrounded, and a dolphin's tail.
[³² But oh l 'tis far, far safer with delay
ι,“ Still round jand round to plow the watry way, 575
ζ ‚And coast Pachynus, than with curious eyes
To see th’ enormous den where Scylla lies ;
υ The dire tremendous fury to explore,
where, round her cavern’d rocks, her watry monsters roar.
Befides‚ if Helenus the truth inspires, γ 580
If Phoebus warms me with prophetie fires;
One thing in chief, O prince of Venus' strain,
i Tho’ oft repeated, I must urge again.

—-About her middle round
A cry of hell-hounds, never ceafing bark’d,
With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung
A hideo'us peal: yet, when they list, would creep,
If ought disturb’d their noise, into her womb
And kennel there: yet there still bark’d and howl’d
within, unseen. Far less abhorr’d than these
Vex’d Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian fflore.

Par. Lost, book ii. 654.

Milton seems to have taken the hint of this famous allegory
from these wordsin St. James’s epistle, i. ις. “ When μυεῖ
“ hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sus 3 and Sim, when it
, “ is wished, bringeth forth DEAT11:'' thre LusT, and

δικ, and DEATH, are plainly personify’d. DEATH also,
*Omma-og, is introduced as a person in the Alcestis of Euripides:
Milton, it is well known, ’.κη’-ις a confiant rcadvr of this [ragio
poet, and 1 have somethrsscs {hortu->ht that hc night 'sorrow his
Thamnus from Eu;ipid=.·:.
