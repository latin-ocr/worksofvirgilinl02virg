Diva solo fixos oculos aversa tenebat.

632. Thrice dragg'd.] Perhaps no poet before Virgil, ever
asserted, that the dead body of Hector was dragged three times
about the walls of Troy. The number of turns remarked by
Homer, relate only to the sepulture of Patroclu33 and it is very
probable, that Virgil converted the three circuits about t'he seq
pulture of which Homer had expressly made mention, into
three compass'es round the walls; Ι say that he changed them
in that manner; either thro' defec‘t of memory, or for the
sake of verse. The liberty taken in this alteration has scarce
been imitated by any body ; you no more find the three circuits
round the walls in the authors that lived after virgil than in
those who went before him. BAYLE.

670. And, fix'd in wanden] S-?grais observes, that an ob-
jection has been made to this incidentes AEneas's meeting with
the pistures of the Trojan war. How could the Trojan history
(say some) be in so short a time so particularly known to the
k'arthaginians? And if it were, had they no exploits of them-
selves or ancestors, to adorn their temples with, but were they
forced to fetch them from Greece and Troy ? The answer is in
substance as follows: Seven years had paffed fince the conclu-
sion of that war, according to Virgil's account ε nothing in the
world had been ever so rencwned 3 the gods and religion of these
nations were the same: there might be, nay Virgil hints that
there were, other decorations ef the temple, befides this:
though none of them was so likely to detain the eye of
Italicas.
