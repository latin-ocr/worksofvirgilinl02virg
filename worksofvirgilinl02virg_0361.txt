Book 4.· ἃ ΤΗΒ AEmzm or Vmcn„ 349

My vengeful spirit {hall thy torments know,
And smile with transport in the realms below.
With that, abrupt she took her sudden flight3
sick of the day, {he loaths the golden light3
And turns, while fault'ring he attempts to say 565
Ten thousand things, disdainfully away3
Sunk in their arms the trembling handmaids led
The fainting princess to the regal bed.
q But though the pious hero tries with care,
And melting words, to soothe her fierce despair, 570
Stung with the pains and agonies of love,
Still he regards the high commands of Jove3
Repairs the fleet; and soon the busy train
Roll down the lofty vessels to the main.
New-rigg’d‚ the navy glides along the flood ; 575
Whole trees they bring, unfashion’d from the wood,
And leafy saplings to supply their oars‚
Pour from the town, and darken all the ffiores.¹
So when the pismires‚ an industrious tram,
Embody’d, rob some golden heap of grain, 580
Studious, ere stormy winter frowns, to lay
Safe in their darksom cells the treasur’d prey3

In one long traek the dusky legions lead
Their prize in triumph through the verdant mead:

Here, bending with the load, a panting throng 585

With force conjoin'd heave some huge grain along :

Some last) the stragglers to the task affign'd,

Some, to their ranks‚ the hands that lag behind :

They crowd the peopled path in thick array,

Glow at the work, and darken all the way. 590
At that sad prospdt, that tor-menting scene,

What thoughtS, what woes were thine, unhappy queen!

How loud thy gmans, when from thy lofty tow'r

Thy eyes survey’d the tumult on the shore5

WVhen on the floods thou heard’st the shouting train 595

Plow with resounding oars the watry plain ?
