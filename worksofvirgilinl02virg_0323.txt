VIRGIL’S AENRID.

THE

FOURTH BOOK.

UT love inflam'd the queen3 the raging pain
Preys on her beart, and giows in every vein.
Much she revolves the hero’s deeds divine,
And much the glories of his godlike line3
Each look, eacii accent breaks her golden rest, 5
Lodg'd in her foul, and imag'd in her breast.
The morn had chas'd the dewy shades away,
And o’er the world advanc’d the lamp of day 3
When to her sister thus the royal dume
Discios'd the secret of her growing flame. 10
Anna, what dreams are these that haunt my rest?
Who is this hero, this our godiike guest?
Mark but his graeeful port, his mauly charms3
How great a prince ἒ and how reuown’d in arms !

is however undeniable that virgil has bom-owed largely from
Apollonius’s description of Medea’s passion; which} believe
he did, not from any barrenness of invention, but from n
love of a beautiful original. ‘virgil was capable of writing as
well even if he had never seen Apollonius.

3. Much fhe revolves the hera's dei-ds ‹ii-vim] Dido endeavourss
to persuade herself, that it was, ihc exaitcd morit :md virtu<- of
the hero, nothis person, that sszc: was fond of: the usu-„21 and
natural artifice of thia inssnuating pastiou of love !
