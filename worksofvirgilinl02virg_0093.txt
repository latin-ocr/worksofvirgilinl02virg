Book 1. Tm: AENEm OF Vmonz. 81

Stretch'd on the grass, their bodies they recline, 290
Enjoy the rich repast, and quaff the gen’rous wine.
The rage of hunger quell’d, they pass'd away
In long and melancholy talk the day3
Nor knew, by fears and hopes alternate led,
Whether to deem their friends distress⁷d, or dead. 295
Apart the pious chief, who suffer'd most,
Bemoans brave Gyas and Cloanthus lost :
For Lycus’ fate, for Amycus he weeps,
And great Orontes, whelm'd beneath the deeps.
Now, from high heav'n, imperial Jove surveys 300
The nations, shores, and navigable seas ;
There, as he sate, inthron'd above the skies,
Full on the Libyan realms he fix’d his eyes.
When lo ! the mournful queen of love appears ;

Her starry eyes were dim’d with streaming tears 3 30 5
Who to the fire her humble suit address'd,

The schemes of fate revolving in his breast.
Oh thou l whose sacred, and eterna] sway‚
Aw’d by thy thunders‚ men, and gods obey;

Virgil‚ says he, is very barren in this part of his poem, [the
diverfity of charaflers] and has but little varied the manners of
the principal persons in it. His AEneas is a compound of va·
lour and piety3 Achates calls himself his friend, but takes no
occasion of shewing himself so: Mnestheus, Sergestus, Gyas,
and Cloanthus, are all of them men of the same stamp and
character. Virgil was so very nice and delicate a writer, that
probably he might not think his compliment to Augustus sn
great, or so artfully concealed, if he had scattered his praises
more promiscuoussy, and made his court to others in the [ame
poem. Had he entertained any such design, Agrippa must in
justice have challenged the second place3 and if Agrippa's re..
presentative had been admitted, AEneas would have had very
little to d0; which would not have rcdounded much to the ·
honour of his emperor. If therefore virgil has shadowed any·
great person besides Augustus in his characlers, they are to be
found only in the meaner atton of his poem, among tlte dis-
puters for a petty vic‘tory in the fifth book, and perhaps in some
few other places.

is borrowcd from Νεανίας, Bell. Punic. Lib. 1.
