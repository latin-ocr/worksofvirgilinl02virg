Quaffataeque rates, dum non trastabile caelum.

His dietis incensum animum inflammavit amore,
Spemque dedit dubiae menti, solvitque pudorem. 55
Principio delubra adeunt, pacemque per aras

Exquirunt : madiam lenitas de more bidentis

Legiferae Cereri, Phoeboque, patrique Lyaeo :

Junoni ante omnis, quoi vincla jugalia curae.

Ipsa tenens dextra pateram pulcherrima Dido, ὃς
Candentis vaccae media inter cornua fundit z

Aut ante ora deum pinguis spatiatur ad aras,

Instauratque diem donis 3 pecudumque reclufis
Pectoribus inhians spirantia consulit exta'.

Heu vatum ignarae mentes ! quid vota furentem, 6 5
Qid delubra juvant ? est mollis flamma medullas
Interea, ac tacitum vivit sub peitore volnus.

Uritur infelix Dido, totaque vagatur

Urbe furens : qualis conjee‘ta cerva sagitta,

Quam procul incautam nemora inter Crefia fixit 70
Pastor agens telis, liquitque volatile ferrum

Nescius. >illa fuga filvas saltusque peragrat

Didiaeos : haeret lateri letalis arundo.

the vow she had made to the manes of her first husband,
which to her were a kind of deity. She begins at the same
time to suppose that these manes are no longer concerned about
her, and lay no obligation upon her to keep her vows. Last
of all, being more corrupted, ihc becomes guilty of impiety
against the gods: and seeing that AEneas was about to leave
her by their order, she would persuade him that they are quite
ignorant and unconcerned at what is done here on earth.
Not that she was really and absolutely persuaded of so impi- ¹
