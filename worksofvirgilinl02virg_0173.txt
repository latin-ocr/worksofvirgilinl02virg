Book 2· THE AENEn) oF Vmcn„ 151

O’erwhelms the fields, lays waste the golden grain,

And headlong sweeps the forests to the main3 410

Stun'd at the din, the swain with list'ning ears

From some steep rock the founding tuin hears.
Now Heeror’s warning prov'd too clear and true,

The wiles of Greece appear'd in open view3

The roaring flames in volumes huge aspire, 415 ¹

And wrap thy dome, Deiphobus, in fire3 Δ

Thine, fage Ucalegon, next strow’d the ground,

And stretch'd a vast unmeasur’d ruin round.

Wide o’er the waves the bright reflee'fion plays,

The surges redden with the distant blaze. 420

Then shouts and trumpets ¹swell the dire alarms 3

And, tho' 'twas vain, I madly flew to arms ε

Eager to saise a band of friends, and pour

In one firm body, to defend the tow'r3

Rage and revenge my kindling bosom fire, 425

Warm, and in arms, to conquer or expire.

But lo Ι poor Pantheus, Phoebus’ priest appears,

Just scap’d the foe, distrafi-ed with his fears,

The fage his vanquish'd gods and reliques bore,

And with his trembling grandson fought the shore. 43ss
Say, Pantheus, how 'che fate of Ilion stands ?

Say, if a tow'r remains in Trojan hands?

He thus with groans 3—-Our last sad hour is come,

Our certain, fixt, inevitable doom.

Troy once was great, but oh ! the scene is o'er, 435

, Her glory vanish’d‚ and her name no more !

For partial Jove transfers her past renown
To Greece, who triumphs in her burning t0wn3

apartment of Pharaoh ; and to mix cannons and carabines with
the ancient arrows in the battles of Joshua.

435. Troy once was grean] virgil had his eye undoubtedly
on a paffage in the Troades of Euripides, where Andromache
and Hecuba speak, as follows,

ANAP.—··wa ποτ’ ημεν.
