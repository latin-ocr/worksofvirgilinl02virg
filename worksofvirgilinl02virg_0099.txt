In Greece‚ Assaracus, his sons {hall reign, 380
And vanquish’d Argos wear the vicTtor’s chain.
Then Caesar, call'd by great Iiilus name,
(Whose empire ocean bounds‚ the stass his farne)
Sprung from the noble Trojan line, shall rise
Charg’d with his E‘astern spoi18‚ and mount the ssczies. 385
Him, shall you see, advanc'd to these abodes ς
Ad'or'd by Rome3 a god among the gods.
From that blest hour all violence {hall cease,
The age grow mild 3 and soften into peace.
With rightcous Rhemus shall Qirinus reign, 390
Old saith, and Vesta, shall return again 3

Within the fane dire Fury shall be bound,
With a huge heap of {hatter’d arms around 3 395
Wrapt in an hundred chains, beneath the load
The fiend {hall roar, and grind his teeth in blood.

must the pleasure double on those who could compare the poet
and the statuary togethcr3 and see which had put most horror
and distraetion in his figure ! But we, who live in these lower
ages of the world, are such entire strangers to this kind of
diversion, that we often inistal-:e the description of a piEture
for an allegory, and don’t so much :is know when it is hinted
at.” Auoisox’s Dzffi'rtation, Sec.
