Book 4. THE AENzn) οι·- Vnum. 325

Next with the youthful Trojahs to the sport

The fair Ascanius iffues from the court.

But far the fairest, and supremely tall,

Tow’rs great AEneas, and outihines thern aIl.

As when from Lycia bound in wintry frost, 215

Where Xanthus’ streams enrich the smiling coast,

The beauteous Phoebus in high pomp retires,

And hears in Delos the triumphant quires 3

The Cretan crowds and Dryopes advance,

And painted Scythians round his altars danee3 220

Fair wreaths of vivid bays his head infold,

His locks bound backward and adorn‘d with gold ς

The god majestic moves o'er Cynthus' brow3,

His golden quiver rattling as be goes :

So mov’d AEneas; such his charmIng grace3 225

So glow'd the purple bloom, that flufh’d his godlike face.
Soon as the train amid the mountains came,

And storm'd the covert of the savage game3

The goats flew bounding o’er the craggy brow

From rock to rock, and fought the fields below. 230

Here the fleet stags‚ chas'd down the tow’ring steep,

In clouds of dust through the long valley sweep :

both in the poet, and in the max-bie, this god is represented as
the standard of beauty3 that this divine beauty of his, and h}s
motion, are the two principal points aimed at by Virgil in tJns
similitude, and the two chief things that strike one in viewmg
the Apollo Bel-uidere ; and on the whole, that if the one was
’ not copied from the other, they are at least so much alike,
that they may very well serve to give a mutual light to each
other. I’olymetis, Dial. vixi.

It may be added, that this comparison is manifestly borrowcd
from Apollonius, B. i. Arg. where it is introduced on occafion
of Jason marching out to launch the {bip ArgO.

224· His golden quiver rattling.] This is copied from Ho-
mer’s figure of Apollo, Iliad. 1. ver. 76. but as Dr. Clatrkc
finely and acutely observes, has not the beauty and proprxety
of the original. Homer says the arrows rattled,

Aura κινηθεντος
Venustior in eo Homeri hic quam Virgilii alocutio, qubd ΙκΑτι
describitur incffts, paulo utique inaequabilior.
