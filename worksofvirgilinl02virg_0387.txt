Book 4. THE AEm-:m οε Vmerr..¹ , 375

Her sudden fate is blaz’d the city round ς

The length’ ni ng eries fr om street to street resound ς

Tof ema le stirieks the regal dome replies,

And the shrill echoes ring amidst the skies; 960

As all fair Carthage‚ or her mother Tyre, ,

Storm'd by the foe, had sunk in floods of fire3

And the fierce ssame devour'd the proud abodes,

With all the glorious temples of the gods. v
Her breathless sister runs with eager pace, 965¹

And beats her throbbing breast, and beauteous face.

Fierce through the parting crowds the virgin flies‚

And on her dying dear Eliza eries,

&Vas this, my Dido, ah l was this the way ,

You took, your easyrfister tovbetray ,Ρ 970

VVas it for this my hands prepar'd the pyre‚

The fatal altar, and the funeral fire?

Where shall my plaints begin ?--ah ! wretch undone

Now left abandon'd to my woes alone !

Was I unworthy then, to yield my breath, 975·

And share thy sweet society in death ?

Me, me you should have call'd, your fate to share

From the same weapon‚ and the same despair.

And did these hands' the lofry pile compose Β

Did I invoke our gods with solemn vows ? · 980

Only—a h crue ⁹¹1 Ῐ to be sent away ¹

From the sad scene of death Ι now survey. Ρ

You by this fatal stroke, and I, and all·,

Your senate, people‚ and your Carthrge fall.

Bring, bring me water3 let me bathe in death 985

Her bleeding wounds, and catch her parting breath.

Then up the steep ascent she flew, and prcst

Her dying sister to her heaving breast;

With eries succeeding eries her robes unbound,

To staunch the blood that iffu’d from the wound. 990

Bba.
