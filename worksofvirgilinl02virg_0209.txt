Book 2. THE AEmzm or Vmon„ 197

That o’er the palace, gliding from above,
To point our way, descends in Ida’s grove3
Then left a long continu’d stream in view,
The track still glittering where the glory flew. 940
The flame past gleaming with a bluifh glare,
And smokes of sulphur fill the tainted air.
At this convinc’d, arose my reverend fire,
Address’d the gods, and hail'd the sacred fire.
Proceed, my friends, no longer Ι delay, 945
But instant follow where you lead the way.
Ye gods, by these your omens, you ordain
That from the womb of fate {hall rise again,
To light and life, a glorious second Troy ;
Then save this house, and this auspicious boy3 950
Convinc'd by omens so divinely might,
I go, my son, companion of thy ssight.
Thus he-and nearer now in curling spires
Through the iong walls roll'd on the roaring fires.
Haste then, my fire, I cry'd, my neck ascend, 955
With joy beneath your sacred load I bend ;
Together will we share, where-e'er I go,
One common welfare, or one common woe-
Ourself with care will young Imus lead ς
At safer distance you my spouse succeed z 960
Heed too these orders, ye attendant train ;
VVithout the wall stands Ceres’ vacant fane,
Rais'd on a mount ; an aged cyprcss near,
Proserv-’d for ages with rcligious sear 3
Thsther, from different roads affmnbhng, corne, 965
And meet embodicd at the sacred dome :
Thou, thou, my sire, our gods and relies bear3
These hands, yet horrid with the stains of war,

The render is defired to bear this observation in his mind,
which will serve to clear up a variety of passages and inctdcnts
throughout the poem; and for want of attending to whrch‚
Virgil’s aim and meaning have been frequently mismterpretcd
and misunderstood.
