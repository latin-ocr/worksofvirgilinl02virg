Book 1. THE AEmzm oF Vmon.. 123

Now Cupid, pleas’d his orders to obey,
Brought the rich gift83 Achates led the way.
He carne, and found on costly carpets spread
The queen majestic midst her golden bed.
The great AEneas and the Trojans lie 940
On pompous couches stain’d with Tyrian dye :
Soft towels for their hands th? attendants bring,
And linxpid water'from the crystal spring,
They wassi ; the menial train their tables spread 3
And hcap in glitt'ring canisters the bread. 945
To dress the feast, full fifty haudmaids join, γ s
And burn rich incense to the pow'rs divine 3
A hundred boys and vir'gins stood around‚
The banquet marshall'd‚ and the goblet crown'd.
To fill th' embroider'd beds the Tyrians come 9 50
Rank behind rank 3 and crowd the regal room.
The guests the gorgeous gifts and boy admire,
His voice, and looks, that glow with youthful fire3
The veil and foliage wond'ring they behold,
‚And the rich robe that flam'd with figur’d gold: 95¹5
But chief the queen, the boy and presents move,
The queen, already doom'd to fatal love.
Insatiate in her joy, {he sate amaz'd,
Gaz’d on his face, and kindled as ssie gaz'd.
First, his diffembled father he carest, 960
Hung round his neck, and play’d upon his breast3
Next to the queen's embraces he withdrew3
She look’d, and sent her soul at ev’ry view ε
Then took him on her lap, devour’d his charms ;
Nor knew poor Dido, blind to future harms, 965}
How great a god ssie fondled in her arms.
But he, now mindful of his mother, stole
By ssow degrees Sichaeus from her foul 3
Her foul, rekindling, in her husband’s stead,
Admits the prince ; the living for the dead. 970
