Book 2. *THE AEm—:m or Vmcn„ *- ¹39

Here rang’d the thousand veffels stood, and there

In c011fli6’csj0i11’d the furious sons of war. 40

Some view the gift of Pallas with surprize‚ -

The fatal monster, and its wondrous fize.

And first Thymoetes mov’d the crowd to lead

And lodge within the tower the lofty steed ;

Or, with defign, his country to destroy, 45

‘Swift as the word, his pond’rous lance he threW3

Against the fides the furious javelin ssew,

Thro’ the wide womb a spacious passage found,

And [hook wiih long vibrations in the wound.

The monster groans, and snakes the distant stiore ; 70

And, round his caverna roll’d‚ the deep'ning thunders roar-
