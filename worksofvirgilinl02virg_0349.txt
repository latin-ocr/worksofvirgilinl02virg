Book 4. Tm: AEmzm OF Vinea. 337

As the swift sea-mens, for the fflhy prey,
In low excurfions skims along the sea, }
By rocks and shores, and wings th’ aerial way3
So, from his kindred mountain, Hermes flies 375
Between th’ extended earth and starry skies 3
Thus through the parting air his course he bore,
And, giiding, skimm'd along the Libyan shore.
Soon as the winged god to Carthage carne, ,
“ He finds the prince forgetful of his fame : 380
The rising domes employ his idle hours,
Th’ unfinished palaces and Tyrian tow’rs.
A sword all starr’d with gems, and spangled o’er
With yellow jaspers, at his side he wore 3
A robe refulgent from his shoulders flow'd, 385
That, flaming, deep with Tyrian crimson glow’d3
The work of Dido; whose unrivall'd art
With flow'rs of gold embroider’d every part. Β

To whom the god z—These hours canst thou employ'*
To raise proud Carthage‚ heedless prince of Troy? 390⁴
Thus for a foreign bride to build a town
And form a state, forgetful of thy own ?
The Lord of heav'n and earth, almighty Jove,
With this command dispatch’d me from above3

is the most proper that could be employed on that particular oc-
cafion, 1 call it well adapted. This Itake to be the case in
Virgil’s introducing Mercury, on the occasion abovementioned.
It was a supposed fan, among the Romam, that AEneas came
into Italy in consequence of the will of Heaven, and the express
order of the gods, declared in oracles and prophecies. What
they thus supposed, Virgil realizes. The Fates, or will of
Heaven, in virgil, is Jupiter giving his orders 3 and the declara-
tion of it to AEneas is expreffed by Mei-cury, (the usual meffen—
ger of the will of Heaven) coming down to him ; and giving
him the orders he had fromJupiter. This machinery then is
both obvious and well adapted : and we may add, that it could
scaree be better timed‚ than when AEneas was at the greatest
stop he met with in his whole voyage to Italy 3 and when he
was most in danger of quitting his dessgn.''
