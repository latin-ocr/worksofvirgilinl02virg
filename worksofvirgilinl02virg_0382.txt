Litora litoribus contraria, fluffibus undas

Inprecor, arma armis: pugnent ipfique nepotesque.
Haec ait, et partis animum versabat in omnis ; 630
Invisam quaerens quam primum abrumpere lucem.

Tum breviter Barcen nutricem adfata Sichaei ;

Namque suam patria antiqua cinis ater habebat:
Annam, cara, mihi, nutrix, huc fiste sororem ε

Dic corpus properet fluviali spargere lympha, κ 635
Et pecudes secum et monstrata piacula ducat :

Sic veniat. tuque ipsa pia tege tempora vitta.

Sacra jovi Stygio, quae rite incepta paravi,

Perficere est animus, finemque inponere curis ;
Dardaniique rogum capitis permittere flammae. 640
Sic ait. illa gradum studio celerabat anilem.

At trepida, et coeptis inmanibus effera Dido,
>Sanguineam volvens aciem, maculisque trementis
Intersusa genas, etvpallida morte futura, 1
Interiora domus inrumpit limina, et altos 645

923. Now to the fatal comm] To paint, is not only to
describe thing33 but to represent the circumstances of them,
in' suc'n a lively ssenfible manner, that the hearer shall fancy
he almost sees them with his eyess For instance: if a dry
historian were to give an account of Dido’s death, he would
only say3 she was overwhelmed with sorrow after the depar-
ture of AEne'as ; and that she grew weary of her life : so she
went up to the top of her palace3 and lying down on her fu-
neral pile, ihe stabbed herself. Now these words would in-
form you of the ῐειέὶς but you do not see it. Vthn you read
the story in virgil, he sets it before your eyes. W'hen he re-
presents au >the circumstances of Dido’s despair; destxibess
her wild rege ; and death already staring in her aspeft : when
he makes her speak at the fight of the piSture and sword that
AEneas left, your imagination transports you to Carthageg
where you see the Trojan fleet leaving the more, and the
queen quite inconsolable. You enter into all her paffions, and
into the sentiments of the supposed spessators. It is not virgil
you then hear: you are too attentive to the last words of un-
