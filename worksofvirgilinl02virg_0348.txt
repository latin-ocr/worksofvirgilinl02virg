Mifit3 avi similis, circum quae litora, circum

Piscosos scopulos humilis volat aequora juxta. 255
Haud aliter, terras inter caelumque, volabat

Litus arenosum Libyae, ventosque secabat

Materno veniens ab avo Cyllenia proles.

Ut primurn alatis tetigit magalia plantis,

virgil was constrained to use it here, or the honesty of this hero
would be ill-defended. Mr. Spence lias solidly andjudicioussy
refuted this objeetion. “ I must own to you, that this very ma-

very well adapted. What the vulgar believed to be brought
about by the will of their gods, the poets described as carried on
by a visible interpofition of those gods ; and this to rne seems
the whole mystery cfthe machinery of the ancients.—When the
