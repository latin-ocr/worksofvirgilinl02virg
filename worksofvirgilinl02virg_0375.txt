Book 4. Tm: AEmzm 0ιὲ· kacn. Ι 363

What 1-1hall I follow through the roaring main,
. Sole and abandon’d, their triumphant train‚

Or drive 'ern through the deeps with sword and fite, 785
With all my armies, all the sons> of Tyre ?

But can I draw to sea those Tyrian bands

I drew relucstant from their native lands ἒ

Die then as thou deserv'st ; in death repose ;

The sword, the friendly sword, shall end thy woes. 790
You first, dear fister, by my sorrows mov’d‚

Expos’d me rashly to the wretch I lov'd;

Your prompt obedience‚ and officious care

Fann’d the young flame‚ and plung’d me in despair.

Oh ! had Ι learn'd like savages to rove, 795
And never known the woes of brida] love !

I prov’d unfaithful to my former spouse,

And now I reap the fruits of broken vows 1

Thus vents the mournful queen, by love oppaest,

The grief that rag'd tumultuous in her breast. 800
Meantirne with all things ready for his ssight,

In thoughtless sseep the hero past the night.

To whom again the feather’d Hermes carne,

His youthful figure, looks and voice the same,

And thus alarms the ssurnb'ring prince once more3 805
What—canst thou sseep in this important hour?

Nor all thy dangers canst thou yet survey?

Nor hear the zephyrs call thee to the sea ?

Mad as thou art 1—d2termin’d on her doom,

She forms defigns of mischiefs yet to come. 810
Then fly her fury while thou yet canst fly,

Before Aurora gilds the purple sky 3

Fly‚—or the floods {hall soon be cover’d o’er
“ With numerous flects, and armies crowd the shore,
And direful brands with long-projedted rayS, 815
Shall set the land and ocean in a blaze.
Ev’n now her dread revenge is on the wing;

Rise, prince5 a woman is a changeful thing.
