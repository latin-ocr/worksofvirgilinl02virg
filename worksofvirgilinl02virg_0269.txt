Book 3. THE AENem or Vmon„ '257'

Ῑ hung the brazen buckler on the door,

Which once in fight the warlike Abas bore3

And thus inscrib’d-Th'ese arms with blood maine,

From conquering Greece the great AEneas gain'd3 385

Then, rous'd at my command, the failors sweep

And dash with bending oars the sparkling deep.

Soon had we lost Phaeacia’s finking tow'rs‚

And skimm’d along Epirus' flying shores.

On the Chaoniam port at length we fall 3 390

Thence we ascend to high Buthrotos' wall.

Ast‘oniih’d here a strange report we found,

That Trojan Helenus in Greece was crown'd.

The captive prince, (vie'torious Pyrrhus dead‚)

At once succeeded to his throne and bed3 395

And fair Andromache, to Troy restor'd‚

Once more was wedded to a Dardan lord.

With eager joy I left the fleet, and went

To hail my royal friends, and learn >the strange event.
Before the walls, within a gloomy w00d‚ 400

Where a new Simois roll'd his filver flood;

By chance, Andromache that moment paid

The mournful offerings to her Ηεὲῒοῑέ {hade-

A tomb‚ an empty tomb her hands compose

Of living turf3 and two fair altars rose. 405

Sad scene Ι that still provok'd the tears flue {hed 3

And here the queen invok'd the mighty dead.

When lo Ι as I advanc'd3 and drew more nigh,

She saw my Trojan arms and enfigns fly3

402. By chance, Andromacha] This unexpeoed meering with
Andromache (and at the tomb of Hebion) has an infinite
beauty, and must be very pleafing to the rcader: her surprize
at the fight of the Trojan arms is naturally painted.

404. An empty tomb.] The bones of Hector were not depo·
sited in this tomb. It was empty, and therefore Virgil styles
it, inanem .· it was literally what the Latius called monumentum.

CA‘r Rou-

It is probable Catrou might mean Censtaphium.
