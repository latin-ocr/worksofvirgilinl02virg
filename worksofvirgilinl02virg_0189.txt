Book 2. THE AENEm oF VIR'G'IL. 177

The trembIIng matrons fly from place to place,
And kiss the pillars with a last embrace 3 650
Bold Pyrrhus storms with all his father's fire3
The 'barriers burst 3 the vanquiffi’d guards retire3
The {hatter’d doors the thund’ring engines ply 3
'The bolts leap back3 the founding hinges fly3
The war breaks in3 loud shout the hostile train 3 655
The gates are storm'd 3 the foremost soldiers ssain ε
Through the wide courts the crowding Argives roam,
And swarm triumphant round the regal dorne.
Not half so fierce the foamy deiuge bounds,
And bursts refistless o'er the level'd mounds 3 660
Pours down the vale, and rO'aring o'er the plain,
Sweeps herds‚ and hinds, and houses to the main.

These eyes within the gate th' Atrides view’d,
And furious Pyrrhus cover'd o'er with blood 3
Sad they beheld, amid the mournful scene, 663
The hundred daughters with the mother queen,

And Priam's self polluting with his gore
Those flames, he hallow'd at the {hrines before.-

The fifty bridal roOmS, a work divine !

(Such were his hopes of a long regal line) 670ss
Rich in Barbarie gold, with trophies cmwn’d,

Sunk with their proud support of pillars round 3

And, where the flames retire, the foes possess the ground*

And now·‚ great queen, you haply long to know,
The fate of Priam in this general woe.· 675·

When with sad eyes the venerable fire
Beheld his Ilion suni< in hostile fire3

His palace storm'd‚ the lofty gates laid low,
His rich pavillions crowded with the foe 3

674. And now.] This is the only line, throu hout all
AEneas’z narration, in which he takes notice of his aucizience.
