Hic, ait: et nostris inluserit advena regnis ?

Non arma expedient, totaqueex urbe sequentur,
Diripientque rates alii navalibus? ite,

Ferte citi flammas, date vela, inpellite remos.

Quid loquor? aut ubi sum? quae mentem insania mutat?
Infelix Dido ! nunc te fata inpia tangunt. 596
Turn decuit, cum sceptra dabas. en dextra fidesque!
Qem secum patrios aiunt portare Penatis :

Quem subiisse humeris confectum aetate parentem!

Non potui abreptum divellere corpus, et undis 600
Spargere ? non socios, non ipsum absumere ferro

which is so rare among the orators is common among the poets:
they abound in instantes of this kind, where one may see the
paflion prepared, and kept up by the aetion. Dido begins her
speech, “ O Jupiter! what, shall this stranger go off? &c.
This is no surprize to the hearers 3 they were so well prepared
¹for it, that they would have wondered if the beginning of this
speech had been less paffionate. The praEtice of Seneca is
quite contrary. If he h-as any recital to make, which ought
to imprint some great paffion or other3 he takes away both

by a fine and elegant description of some place or other, which
only serves to shew the copiousness and the over—luxuriant wit ,
of a poet without judgment. In the Troades, Hecuba and 1
Andromache wanted to hear of the barbarous death of Astya- ⁴
nax, whom the Greeks had thrown from the top of an high .’1
tower. It mightily concerned them indeed to know, that ›
among the crowd that flocked from all quarters to that sad ‘
spectacle, some there were who stood on the ruins of the old ·
decayed buildings, others whose legs trembled under them, ξ’
because they were mounted so high. ῑ

Those who have the patience to speak or hear such idle 5'
stuff, are so little inclined to weep‚ that they stand in.·need of ²
notice, as the mercenary mourners of old had, when it in
time to begin uttering their lamentations.
