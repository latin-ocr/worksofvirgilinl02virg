Book 2. THE AEmzm or VmGrL. 163

And the hug'e monster from his op’ning fide ξ
Pom-s forth her warriors in' an endless tide3 440
5{Vith joy proud Sinon sees the flames aspire,
Heaps blaze on blame, and mingles fise with ἶπες
Here thousands pouring through the gates appear,
Far more than proud Pvlycenae sent to war.
Some seiae the paffes, groves of spears arise, 445
That thirst for blood, and flash against the skies.
The guards but just maintain a feeble fight
With their fieree foes, amidst the gloomy night.

While Pantheus' words, while ev’ry god inspires,
I flew to arms, and ruffi’d amidst the fires, 450
WVhere the loud furies call, where ihouts and erles
Ring round the walls, and thunder in the skies.
Now faithful Ripheus on my fide appears,
With hoary Iphitus, advane'd in years 3
And valiant Hypazis and Dymas, known 455
By the pale splendors of the glimm'ring moon ς ,
With these Choroebus, legdon's generous boy,
Who came, ill-fated, to the wars of Troy ;
Fir’d with the fair Caffandra’s blooming charms,
To aid her fire with unavailing'arm33 460ss
Ab brave unhappy youth l—he would not hear
His bride inspir'd‚ who warn⁷d him from the war!

These when I saw, with fieree collec9oed might,
Breathing revenge, and crowcling to the fight 3
With warmth I thus address’d the gen’rous train: 465¹
Ye bold, brave youths, but boll and bravo in vain !
If by your dauntless souls impell'd, you dare
With me to try th’ exn-emities of war3
You see our hopeless state; how every god,
Who guarded Troy, has lest his old abode, ⁴ 4701,
You aid a town already sunl< in ἦγες “
Fly, fly to arms, and gloriously expire3
Let all rusb on, and, vanquish’d aps we are,

Catch one last bearn of safety from despaIr.
