Book 1. THE AEmzm οι· Vnum. 99‘

The Tyrians ply their work ; with many a groan

These roll, or heave some huge unwieldy stone3

Those bid the lofty citadel ascend3

Some in vast length th' embattled walls extend3 565
Others for future dwellings choose the ground,

To take the burdens, and relieve their friends ;

Warm at the fragrant work, in hands, they drive

The drone, a lazy robber‚ from the hive.

gaged in publishing the latter of these writers. pIt will be
both useless and impossible in the course of these notes to point
out all Virgil’s imitation& of Homer. This is already done
