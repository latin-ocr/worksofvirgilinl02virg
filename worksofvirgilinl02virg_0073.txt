Book 1. Tne AENEm or V1Ro11..'

Doom’d by the Gods a length of wars to wage,
And urg’d by Juno’s unrelenting tage 3
Ere the brave hero rais 'd‚ in these abo-des,

His destin‘ d walls, and fix' d his wate-1. ring gods.

Hence the fam' d Latian line and ienae& cca-no,

ᾗ

And the proud triumphs, and the tow re- or taem?

Say, Mose, what causes could so far incense
Celestial pow'rs, and what the dire offence
That mov'd heav’n's aweful cmpress to impose
On such a pious prince a weight of woes,
Expos'd to dangers, and with toils opprest ?
Can rage so fierce inflame an heavenly breast?

Against th' Italian coast, of ancient fame
A city rose, and Carthage was the name3
A Tyrian colony 3 from Tiber far3
Rich, rough, and brave, and exercis’d in war.
Which Juno far above all malms, above
Her own dear Samos, honour’d with her love.
Here stood her chari0t‚ here her armour lay,
Here ss1e defign’d, would destiny give way,
Ev'n then the seat of universal sway.

But of a race ihe heard, that should destroy
The Tyrian tow’rs, a race deriv'd from Troy,

Who proud in arms, triumphant by their swords,
should rise in time, the world’s victorious Iords;

By fate defign'd her Carthage to subdue,
And on her ruin’d empire raise a new.

This fear'd the goddess; and in mind she bore
The late long war her fury rais’d before

For Greece with Troy3 nor was her wrath refigu’d,

But every cause hung heavy 011 her mind ;
Her form disdain'd, and Paris' judgment, roll
Deep in her breaft, and kindle all her soul ;
Th' immortal honours of the raviih'd boy,
And last, the whole detested racc of Troy.
