While round their quiver'd queen the quires advance‚ 67 5

She tow’rs majestic‚ as she leads the dance3 μ

She moves in pomp superior to the rest,

And secret transports touch Latona’s breast.

So pass’d the grsseeful queen amidst her nain,

To speed her labours aud her future reign. 689

Then with her guards surrounded‚ in the gate,

Beneath the spacious dome, sublime {he sate.

She ssmres their labours, or by lots she draws;

And to the crowd administers the laws.

'When lo! AEneas brave Cloanthus spietz, ψ- 685

Antheus, and great Sergestus, with surprize,

Approach the throne, attended by a throng

Of Trojan friends, that pour’d in tides along3

¹Whom the wild whistling winds and tempests bore,

And widely scatter'd on a distant shore. 690

Lost in his hopes and fears, amaz’d he stands,

And with Achates longs to join their hands:

But doubtful of th' event, he first amends,

Wrapt in the cloud, the fortune of his friends;

Anxious‚ and eager till he knew their state‚' 695

And where their veffels lay, and what their fate.

With eries, the royal favour to implore,

They came, a train sele&ed‚ from the shore:

Then, leave obtain’d, Ilioneus begun‚

And? with their common suit, addrest the throne. 720
Oh ! queen{ indulg’d by jove, these lofty tow'rs

And this proud town to raise on Libyan shores,

With high commands‚ a savage race to awe,

And to the barb'rous nativos give the law,

We wretched Trojans, an abandon’d race, 705

Tost round the scas, implore your royal grace5

Probus was of opinion, that Virgil had failed more in this imi-
tation of Homer, than he had in any other. Scaliger affirms
quite the contrary with his usual dogmatical bitterness. See
the fifth book of his Poetics, Chap. 3. passim.
