Then mounted on his radiant car he rides, 200
And wheels along the level of the tides.

As when sedition fires th’ ignoble crowd,

In morals stria, and innocence of life,
All stand attentive ; while the fage controuls

open to the sea; there are little streams perpetually draining·
from the rocks ; and seats of stone formed within, probably for
the use of those who worked in that quarry. There is a clift
on each fide; and the brow of the mountain is overshadowed
with trees.'' Mr. Spsncz, from Dr. SflAw; who has given
a farther account of them in his travels. Pag. 157·
