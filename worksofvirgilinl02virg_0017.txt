DISSERTATION. ς

serf in all that is necessary, for a king, a priest‚ and the
founder of a mmmchy, to know and to praestise. He ·
arrives and finds in this new country the Gods and men
disposed to entertain him‚‘ and to allot him subjedss and
territories. But* a neighbouring prince blinded by jea-
lousy and ambi-tion, cannot see thejustice of thiS pro-
ceeding, nor the⁴ manifest will of Heavcn, declared by
infallible tokens, but vehemently opposes his„ establish÷

a foreign nature, like the trifling novels, which AriostO,
Camoe'ns, Tasso, and Voltairc, have inserted in their
poems. By which the reader is missed into another sort
of pieasure, very opposite to that which is defigncd in an
epic poem. One raises the soul and strengthens it to
virtue3 the other softens and emasculates it again, and
unbends it to vice.

An affion that is one and fimple, which is unfolded
easily and by degrces, and which does not require a con-
