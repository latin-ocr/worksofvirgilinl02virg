Book 2· THE AEm-:m oF Vnum.. 145

Oft' had our hosts determin'd to employ 140
Their sails for Greece, and leave untaken Troy,
Urg’d to a shameful ssight, from deep despair,
And the long labours of a ten years war.
And oh 1 that they had sail’d 1 as oft' the force
Of southern winds, and tempests stop'd their course. 145
But since this steed was rais'd 3 strait, bellowing loud,
Deep thunders roar'd, and burst from ev’ry cloud.
We sent Eurypilus to Phoebus’ shrine,
Who brought this sentence from'the voice divine ς
When first ye sail’d for Troy, ye calm’d the main 150
With blood, ye Grecians, and a virgin ssain ;
And ere you measure back the foamy flood,
Know, you must buy a safe return with blood.

 

These aweful words to ev'ry Greek impart

Surprize and dread, and chill the bravest heart ς 155
To the dire stroke each thought himself decreed,

‚ Himself the νίἑὶίῐη that for Greec‘e should bleed.

Ulyffes then, importunate and lond,

Produc'd sage Calchas ‘to the trembling crowd,

Bade him the secret will of Heav’n relate 160
And now my friends could prophesy my fate;

And base Ulyffes’ wicked arts, they said,

VVere levell'd all at my devoted head.

Ten days the prophet from the crowd retir'd,

Nor mark'd the vidtirn that the gods requir’d. 165
So long besieg'd by Ithacus he stood,

And scem'd reluC’fflnt to the voice of blood 3

At length he spoke, and, as the scheme was laid,
Doom’d to the ssaughter my predestin'd head.

All prais’d the sentence, and were pleas’d to see 170
The fate that threaten'd all, corfin’d to me.

And now the dire tremendous day was come,

 

When all prepar’d to solemnize my doom;

The salted barley on my front was spread,

The sacred fillets bound my destin’d head: 175
