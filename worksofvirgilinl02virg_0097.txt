Book 1. THE AENEm oF Vmcn„

Your eyes Lavinium's promis'd walls shall see,
And here we ratify our first decree.

Your son, the brave AEneas, soon snall rise,
Himself a god 3 and mount the starry sszies.
To soothe your care, these secr-ets I relate
From the dark volumes of eternal Fate:

The chief fair Italy shall reach, and there
With mighty nations wage a dreadful war,
New cities raise, the savage nations awe,

And to the conquer’d kingdoms give the law.
The fierce Rutulians vanquish’d by his sword,

Three years shall Latium own him sovereign lord.

Your dear Ascanius then, the royal boy,

(Now called Iiilus, fissCC the fall of Troy)
While thirty rolling years their orbs compleat,
Shall wear the crown, and from Lavinium’s seat
Transfer the kingdom, and, of mighty length
Raise tow'ring Alba, glorying in her strength.
There, shall the Trojan race enjoy the pow’r,
And fill the throne three hundred winters more.
Ilia, the royal priestess, next shall bear

Two lovely infants to the god of war.

Nurs’d by a tawny wolf, her eldest son,
Imperial Romulus, shall mount the throne 3
From his own name, the people Romans call,
And from his father Mars, his rising wall.

No limits have I fix'd, of time, or place,

To the vast empire of the godlike race.

Ev’n haughty Juno shall the nation love,

Who now alarms earth, scas, and heav'n almvm
And join her friendly counsels to my own,
With endless farne the sons of Rome to crown,

 

This word be fate
When Troy in dust shall proud Mycenae lay.
