Book 1. Δ Tne AENx-:m or V1RG11.. 77'

Where polish'd seats appear of living stone,

And limpid rills, that tinkle as they run.

No cable here, nor circling anchoi· binds

The floating veffel harrass'd with the winds. 230
The Dardan hero brings to this retreat

Sev‘n {hatter’d ships, the reneis of his fleet-

With fierce desire to gain the friendly strand,

The Trojans leap in raptare to the land, }
.A¹¹d’ drench’d in brine, lie stretch’d along the sand.
Achates strikes the ssim, and from the stroke 236
The lurking seeds of fire in sparkles broke3

The catching flame on leaves and stubble preys,

Then gathers strength, and mounts into a blaze.

Tir'd with their labours„ they prepare to dine, 240
And grind their corn, infe00oed with the brine.

AEneas mounts a rock, and thence surveys

’ The wide and wat’ry prospe& of the sea33

Now hopes the shatter’d Phrygian ssiips to find,
Anthene, or Capys, driving with the wind ; 245
And now, Caicus' glitt'ring arms to spy,

Wide o'er the vast horizon darts his eyeq

The chief could view no veffel on the main3

But three tall stags stalk'd proudly o'er the plain;

Before the herd their bearny fronts they rais’d 3 250
Stretch’d out in length, the train along the valley graz'd.
The Prince, who spy'd 'em on the {hore below,

Stop’d snort— then snatch'd the feather'd {hafts and bow,

one a stronger idea of the false delicacy of the French nation,
and of the incapacity of their language to describe several little
circumstances, which ought to have a place in an epic poem?

242. AEneas mounts a rock.] Nothing can more entertain the
imagination than the hero's mounting this hill to examine on
what kind of coast they were landed, and his seeing no object
but the herd of deer grazing wildly. This amusm prospect,
and the description of that beautiful, retired, an safe har-
bom, in ver. zzo. make a fine contrast to the preceding tumult
,and dreadful images of the storm.
