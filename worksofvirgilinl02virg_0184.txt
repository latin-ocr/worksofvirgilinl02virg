'I'eetorum inter se Priami, postesque relicti

A tergo: infelix qua se, dum regna manebant, 455
Saepius Andromache ferre incomitata solebat

Ad socerOS, et avo puerum Astyana&a trahebat.

Evado ad summi fastigia culminis, unde

Tela manu miseri jaetabant inrita Teucri.

Turrim in praecipiti stantem, summisque sub astra 460
Eduetam teetis, unde omnis Troja videri,

Et Danaum solitae naves, et Achaica castra,

Jun&uras tabulata dabant3 convellimus altis

Sedibus, inpulimusque. ea labsa repente ruinam 465
Cum sonitu trahit, et Danaam super agmina late
Incidit. ast alii subeunt: nec saxa, nec ullum
Telorum interea ceffat genus.

ascend to an old tower‚ and pusti the batt lements of it down
upon the enemy. These are circumstances, of so low a nature
in themselves, as not to admit of being embellissied, or wrought
up to the dig· nity of heroic poetry. Vir‘gil was conscious of
this objection3 and happily found the means of heightening‚
and enlivening, both circumstances by the help of 116ὶίοη
To elevate the affair of the blind postern, he seigns, that thro'

and full of tend mess, the lowness of the circumstance, with

motions of the enemy, and surrey the extent of their whole

which makes its demolition be considered with regret and
pi ty; and quite turns off every thought of ridicule, arifing
from the manner of its tumbling Saenius.
