Nunc media Aenean secum per moenia ducit,
Sidoniasque ostentat opeS, urbemque paratam. 75
Incipit effari, mediaque in voce resistit.

Nunc eadem, labente die, convivia quaerit,

Iliacosque iterum demens audire labores

Exposcit, pendetque iterum narrantis ab ore.

Post, ubi digreffi, lumenque obscura viciffim 80
Luna premit, suadentque cadentia sidera somnos ;

Sola domo maeret vacua, stratisque relic‘tis

Incubat. illum absens absentem auditque videtque 1
Aut gremio Ascanium genitoris imagine capta

Detinet, infandum si fallere posfit amorem. 8 5
Non coeptae adsurgunt turres 3 non arma juventus
Exercent, portusve aut propugnacula bello

Tuta parant ε pendent opera interrupta, minaeque
Murorum ingentes, aequataque machina caelo.

ginning to speak and suddenly stopping short and faultering;v
by her making still new feasts and entertainments for her
lovcr; by her defu-ing to hear his story again and again3 by
her attention to every syllable he spoke; by her remaining in
the hall after the guests were gone, and lying upon the couch
where he sat; by her thinking sne still hears his voice, and
still sees his person, and by her fondly careffing Ascanius.

137. No more the tow’rs, mgfim'fh'd] The moral here is
equally just and noble: nothing can more strongly represent
the pernicious consequentes of this violent pallion; the neglect
it occasions of all useful and necessary affini-93 the indolence
and stupor into which it casts <011 the faculties of mind and
body ; and how it damps and destroys all the noble and worthy
pursuits and aims of mankind. To this purpose Lucretius says
finely, that when a man is deeply in love,

Labitur interea res, et vadimonia fiunt ;
Languent officia, atque aegrotat fama vacillans. B. 4. 1117.
