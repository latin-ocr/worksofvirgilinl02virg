Book 4.‘ ' THE AExtm oi· Vmon.. 321

This Juno saw, and thus the bride of Jove
In guileful terms address’d the queen of love: 145
A high exploit indeed l a glorious name, ”
Unfading trophies and eternal fame,
Yon, and your son have worthily pursu’d ,¹
Two gods a single woman have subdu’d l
To me your groundless jealousies are known, 150
And dark suspicions of this Tyrian town.
But why, why goddess, to what aim or end
In lasting quarrels should we still contend ?
Hence then from strife resolve we both to cease,
And by the nuptial band confirm the peace. 155
To crown your wish, the queen with fond desire
Dies for your son, and melts with amorous fite.
Let us with equal sway prote& the place,
The common guardians of the mingled racc.
Be Tyre the dow’r to seal the glad accord, 160
And royal Dido serve this Phrygian lord.
To whom the queen 3 (who mark'd with piercing eyes
The goddess labouring, in the dark disguise,
To Libyan shores from Latium to convcy
The destin'd seat of universal sway3) 165
Who this allianee madly would deny ?
Or war with thee, dread empress of the sky ?
And oh ! that fortune in the work would join,
With full success to favour the design !
But must I doubt, O goddess, if the fatcs, 170
Or Jove permit us to unite the states.
You, as his confort, your request may move,
And search the will, or bend the mind of jove.
Go then—your scheme before the father lay;
Go 3—and I follow, where you lead the way. 175
