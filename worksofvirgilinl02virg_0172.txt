Sternit agros, sternit sata laeta, boumque labore33
Praecipitesque trahit sylvas, stupet inscius alto
Accipiens sonitum saxi de vertice pastor.

Tum vero manifesta fides, Danaumque patescunt
Insidiae. jam Deiphobi dedit ampla ruinam, 310
Volcano superante, domus; jam proxumus ardet
Ucalegon 3 Sigea igni freta lata relucent.

Exoritur clamorque virum clangorque tubarum.

Arma amens capi03 nec sat rationis in armis :

Sed glomerare manum bello, et concurrere in arcem 315
Cum sociis ardent animi· furor iraque mentem

Transtulit. incensa Danai dominantur in urbe.

And he likewise celebrates Misenus as the trumpeter of AEnea's:
but as Virgil wrote at a time very remote from those heroic
ages, perhaps this liberty may be excused. However, a poet
had better confine himself to customs and manners like a good
paimei-3 and it is equally a fault in either of them, to ascribe
to times and nations any thing with which they were unae--
quainted.

This hath been a rock on which many a poet hath struck„
and made himself highly ridiculous to the judicious and dis-
cerning3 preposterously, and unnaturally mixing modern with
ancient manners and customs. A practice as absurd, to use
Voltaire’s allusion, as it was for certain Italian and Flemish
painters to represent the virgin Mary with a chaplet of beads
hangin g at her girdle, to place Swiss guards at the door of the
