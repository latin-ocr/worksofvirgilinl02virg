And told the nations, that a prince from Troy

The godlike stranger to her bridal bed 3 ’

That both, induiging to their soft defires,

And deas to censure, melt in amorous fires 3

And the long winter pass’d away in love, 285

The to the king Iarbas bent her way;

VJith jealous tage the furious prince inspires,

And all his soul with indignation fires.

In large libations pour the generous wine,
And feast on painted bed33 say, father, say,
If yet thy eyes these flagrant crimes survey. 305

Maeonia mentum mitra crinemque madentem
Subnexus, rapto potitur
