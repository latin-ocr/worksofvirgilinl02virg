Book 1. Tus AEmzm or Vmorr..

Is but to mention whattoo well you know,

Who figh’d my fighs, and wept a mother’s woe-

Him, in her town, the Tyrian queen detaIns,

With soft seducements, from the Latian plains.

But much I fear that hospitable place,
WVhere Juno reigns the guardian of the racc ἰ
And lest this fair occasion {he improve,
Know, I defign to'fire the queen with love 5
A love, beyond the cure of pow’rs divine5

v A love as strong, and violent as mine.

But how the proud Phoenician to surprize
With such a paffion, hear what I advise.
The royal youth, Ascanius, from the port,

Hastes, by his father’s summons, to the court ; '
With costly presents charg'd he takes his way, s
Sav'd from the Trojan flames, and stormy sea; =

But to prevent suspicion, will I steep

His temples in the dews of balmy sseep,

Then to Cythera’s sacred scats remove,

Or softly lay him in th’ Idalian grove.

This one revolving night, thyself a boy,
Wear thou the features of the youth of Troy3

And when the queen, transported with thy charnas,

Amidst the feast, snall strain thee in her arms,
The gentle poison by degrees inspire
Thro’ all her breast3 then fan the rising fire,
And kindle all her foul. The mother said,
With joy thr· goz! her soft commands obey’d.
Aside his quiver, :md his wings he flung,
{And, like the boy Iulus, tript along.

Mean time the goddess on Ascanius throws
A balmy ssumber and a sweet reposc;
Lull'd in her lap to rest, the queen os love
Convey'd him to the high Idaliam grove.
There on a flow'ry bed her charge {hc laid,

And, brcathing round him, rosc the fragrant made.
