Book 4. THE AEmzm οε Vmort. 361

The murmurs of the groves and surges die,

The *stars roll solemn through the glowing sky ;

Wide o'er the fields a brooding filence reigns,

The flocks lie stretch'd along the flow'ry plains 3 760

The furious savages that haunt the woods,

The painted birds, the fishes of the floods ;

All, all, beneath the general darkness, thare

In sseep‚ a soft forgetfulness of care 3

All but the hapless queen 3—for love denies 765

Rest to her thoughts, and ssumber to her eyes.

Her paffions grow still fiercer, and by turns

With love she maddens, and with wrath she burns.

The struggling tides in different motions roll,

And thus she vents the tempest of her soul ε 770
What shall Ι do ?—ss1all Ι in vain implore

The royal lovers Ι disdain’d before?

Or, ssighted in my turn with haughty pride,

Court the fierce tyrant whom I once deny'd ?

Shall I the Trojans base commands obey, 775

Their ssave, their suppliant, through the watry way Β

Yes -for my bounties, and my former aid

By Troy already stand so well repaid Ι

And yet suppose I were inelin'd to go;

The haughty failors would but mock my woc. 780

Hast thou not yet, not yet, Elim, known

The perjur'd sons of proud Laomedon ?
