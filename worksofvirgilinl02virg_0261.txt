Book'g. THE AEmzm 01²· Vmou. - 249

Pursue we now a surer, safer road,
By Phoebus pointed, and obey the god. 253
Gl‘ad we cornply, and leave a few behind 3
Then spread our sails to catch the driving wind ς
Forsake this realm3 the sparkling waves divide,
And the swift veffels shoot along the tide.

Now vanish’d from our eyes the leffening ground ;
-And all the wide horizon stretching round, 261
Above was sky, beneath was sea profound t
When, black’ning by degrees, a gathering cloud,
Charg’d with big storms, frown’d dreadful o'er the flood,
And darken’d all the main 3 the whirlwinds roar, 265 τ
And roll the waves in mountains to the shore.
Snatch’d by the furious gust, the veffels keep
Their road no more, but scatter o’er the deep :
The thunders roll, the forky light’nings fly 3
And in a burst of rain descends the sky. 270
Far from our course was dash'd the navy wide,
And dark we wander o'er the toffing tide.

⁵ Not skilful Palinure in such a sea,
So black with storms, distinguish'd night from day3 }
Nor knew to'turn the helm, or point the way. 275

Three nights, without one guiding star in view,

Three days, without the sun, the navy flew 3

The fourth, by dawn, the swelling shores we spy,

See the thin smokes, that melt into the sky, }
And blueish hills just opening on the eye. 280
We furl the sails, with bending oars divide

· The flashing waves, ami sweep the foamy tide.

Incircled by the vast Ionian main,

Where dwelt Celaeno with her harpy train;
Since Boreas’ sons had chac'd the dircful guests
*From Phineus’ palace, and their wonted feastS.

Safe from the storm the Strophades I gain,

287. From Phineus’ palace.] Phineus was a king of Thrace;

¹ or, as some say, of Axadia. He ordered the eyes of his two

sons
