Book ις Tm: AENEm or Vmoxz. 113

But I will send, my borders to explore‚
And trace the windings of the mazy shore.
Perchance, already thrown on these abodes,
He roams the towns, or wanders thro’ the woods. 780
Rais'd in their hopes the friend and hero stood3
And long'd to break, transported‚ from the cloud.
Oh! goddess-born! cry'd brave Achates, say,
What are your thoughts, and why this long delay? .
All safe you see3 your friends and fleet restor’d3 785
One (whom we saw) the whirling gulf devour'd.
Lo I with the rest your mother’s words agree,
All but Orontes 'scap’d the raging sea.
Swift as he spoke, the vapours break away,
Dissolve in aether‚ and refine to day. 790
Radiant in open view, AEneas stood,
In form and looks, majestic as a god.
Flush’d with the bloorn of youth, his features ffiine,

⁴ His hair in ringlets waves with grace divine.

The Qeen of love the glauce divine supplies, 735
And breathes immortal spirit in his eyes. ’
Like Parian marble beauteous to behold,
Or filver's milder gleam in burnissi'd gold,
Or polish'd iv'ry, {hone the godlike man ε
ΑΙ] stood surpriz’d3 and thus the prince began. 800
AEneas, whom you seek, you here survey;
Escap’d the tempest of the Libyan sea,
O Dido, gracious queen, who make alone
The woes, and cause, of wretched Troy your own3
And {helter in your walls, with pious care, 805
Her sons, the relies of the Greeian νηῒς
Who all the forms of misery have bore,
Storms on the sea, and dangers on the {hore3
Nor wc, nor all the Dardan nation, hurl'd
Wide o’er the globe, and scatter'd round the world, 810
But the good gods, with bleffings‚ shall rcpay '¹
Your bounteous deeris, the gods and only they5
