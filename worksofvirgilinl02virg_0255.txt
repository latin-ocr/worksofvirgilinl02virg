Book 3. THE AENEm οι·- VIRGIL. 243

From hence arriv'd the mother of the gods,
Hence her loud cymbals and her sacred woods:
Hence, at her rites religious silence reigns,
And lions whirl her chariot o’er the plains.
'Then fly we speedy where the gods command, 160
Appease the winds‚ and seek the Cretan land :
Nor distant is the shore 3 if Jove hut smne,
Three days shall Waft us to the blissful isse.
This said; he ssays the viclims due, and loads
In haste the smoking altars of the gods. 165
A bull to Phoebus, and a bull was ssain
To thee, great Neptune, monarch of the main ἑ
Α milk-white ewe to ev’ry western breeze,
A black, to ev'ry storm that sweeps the sezis.
Now fame reports Idomeneuz’ retreat, 170
Expell’d and banish'd from ,the throne of'Crete ;
Free from the foe the vacant region lay t
We leave the Delian shore, and plow the watry way.
By fruitful Naxos, o’er the flood we fly,
Where to the Bacchanals the hills rcply ς 175
By green Donysa next: and Paros steer,
Where, white in air, her glitt'ring rocks appear.
⁴Thence through the Cyclades the navy glidm,
Whose clust'ring issands stud the silver tides.
Loud shout the sailors, and to Crete we fly3 180
To Crete our country, was the general cry.

in this and the following lines hath enlarged a little, (tho’ very
justifiably) and by adding a few descriptive epithets (glittcring
rocks appear, clust'ring issands, ἃς.) hath given us a beautiful
landscape of every different issand and country that the navy
passed by, and hath convey’d as full images os the whole scene
as if we had vicwed it from one of AEneas's ships.

177. IVhere, white in aim] Lord Sandwich said to a gen-
tleman from whom 1 had it; “ that when he past by thc
“ issand of Paros, several parts of it look’d as white to him, as
“ the rising grounds about Turin, then ccx-cred with snow ;”

when he was there, in the year 1740.
