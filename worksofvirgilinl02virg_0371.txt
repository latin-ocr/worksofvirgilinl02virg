Book 4„ Tm: AEmtm οῖ’ Vmou'. 359

Nor deetn’d a lover treacherous to his vows
Should more ami& her than her murdet’d spon-se ς
But rears a pile of oaks and firs on high,
Within the court, beneath thernaked sky. 7 30
With wreaxhs the queen adorn’d the struesture round ς
And with funerea} greens and ga-tlands crown’d z
Next big with death, the sword and robe ss1e spread,
A-··d plac’d the dear, dear image on the bed.

Amidst her altars, with diffievel‘d hairs, 735
Her horrid rites the priestess now prepares.
Thund’ring she calls, in many a dreadful found,
On Chaos hoar, and Erebus profound ;
On hidcous Hecate, from hell's abodes,
(The threefold Dian ἲ) and a hundred gods. 740
The place ssze sprinkled, where her alta-rs stood,
With streams d-iffembled from Avernus‘ ssood,
And black envenom’d herbs she brings, reap’d down
With brazen fickles, by the glimmering moon.
Then crops the potent knots of love with care, 745
That from the young estrange the parent mare.
Now with a sacred cake and iiftcd hands,
All bent on death, before her astar stands
The royal viritim, the devoted fair3
Her robes were gather'd‚ and one foot was bare. 7 50
She calls on every star in solemn state,
Whose guilty beams {hine conscious of her fate:
She calls to witness every god above,
To pay due vengeance for her inj ur’d love.

’Twas night3 and, weary with the toils of day, 755
In soft repose the whole creation lay.

entered the imagination of a poet. Virgil never makes a de-
scription for the sake of the fine verses it may contum, or to
ihew his talent of painting well, but always in order tq
heighten some paffion, and further the astion of the poem.
