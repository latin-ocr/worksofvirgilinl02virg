“ Book 3. THE AENEm or Vmcn.. 255

And whether godieffes, or fiends from hell,

Prostrate before the monstrous forms we fell.

But old Anchises, by the beati'ng floods,

Invok'd with sacrifice the immortal gods 3

And rais'd his hands and voice t-Ye pow'rs divine, 353
Avert these woes, and spare a righteous line.

Then he commands to cut the cords away3

With southern gales we plow the foamy sea.

And, where the friendly breeze or pilot guides‚

With flying sails we stem the murmuring tides. 360
Now, high in view, amid the circling floods

We ken Zacynthus crown'd with waving woods.
Dulichian coasts, and Samian hills we spy,

And proud Neritos tow'ring in the sky.

Rough Ithaca we stuin, a rocky shore, 365
And curse the land that dire Ulyffes bore.

Then dim Leucate swell'd to sight, who sslrouds

His tall aeria] brow in ambient clouds;

Last opem, by degrees, Apollo’s fane,

The dread of sailors on the wintry main. 37⁸0
To this small town, fatigu’d with toil, we haste;

The circling anchors from the prows are cast.

Safe to the land beyond our hopes restor‘d,

We paid our vows to heaven's almighty lord.

' All bright in suppling 0i1‚ my friends employ 375
Their limbs in wrestling‚ and revivc with joy

On A&ian stiores the solemn games of Troy.

Pleas'd we refleet that we had pass'd in peace

Through foes unnurnber'd, and th: towns of Greece.

Meantime the sun his annual raca performs, 380
And blust'ring Boreas fills the Γ. with storms;

littoribus, δερ. especially fince tr ,- change is so easy and natural.
Though the literal sense is here sufficient; yet doubtless Vir-
gil had a farther view to the sports afterwards instituted by
Augustus, iu memory of his νίἑὶοτγ at Aelium.
