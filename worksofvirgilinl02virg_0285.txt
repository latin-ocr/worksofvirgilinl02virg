When thus my fares the royssl seer foretold,

He sent rich gifts of elephant and gold ;

Within my navy's fides large treasures stow’d,

And brazen cauldrons that refu3gent glow'd.

To me the monarch gave a snining mail,

Vvsith ”many ει goideu clasp‚ and golden scale 3

With this, a beauteous radiant belm, that bore

A waving plume 3 the helm that Pyrrhus wore.

My father too with costly gifts he loads‚

And failors he supplies to stem the floods,

And generous steeds, and arms to all rny tutin,

· With skilsul guides to lead us o’er the main.
And now my fite gave orders to unbiud

The gather'd sans, and catch the rifing wind3

Whoxn thus, at parting, the prophetie fage

Address'd with all the reverenee due to age.

O favour'd of the {kies ! whom Venus led

To the high honours of her genial bed,

Her own immortal beauties to enjoy,

And twice preserv'd thee from the flames of Troy ε

Lo ! to your eyes Ausoniam coasts appear ;

- Go—to that rea-im your happy voyage steer.

But far beyond those regions you survey,

Your coasting fieet must cut the lengthen’d way.
Stin, still at distance lies the fatcd place,
Affign’d ny Phoe'ous to the Trojun sace.

Go then, he said, with full success go on,

Ἰ Oh blest ! thrice blest in such a matchlcss son.

Ι Why lovsser {hould my words your course demin,
v Wthn tiu: sofr gales invite you to the main ?
Nor less the queen, her love and grief to teH,

With costly presents takes her sud farewell.
