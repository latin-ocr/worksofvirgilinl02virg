Book 4. THE AENEm' or Vmon„

And thou, O Juno l behd thy awefu‘l head9·
Great queen, and guardian of the bridal bed ς·
Hear thou, dire Heeate ἔ from hell profound,

whose rites nosturnal through the str'eets resound,

Hear all ye furies, fiends‚ and g'ods, who wait
To pay due vengeance for Eliza's fate !
If to the destin’d port the Wreteh must cotiae,-
If such be Jove’s unalterable doom ε
still let him wander, toss’d from place to place,
Far from his country,- and his sori's embrace,
By barbarous nations harrass’d with alarrns ;
And take the field with unsuc'cessful arm83
For foreign aid to distant regions fly3
See all his friends a common carnoge lie;'
And when he gainS, his ruin to compleat,
A peace more {hameful than his past defeat3
Nor life nor empire let him long maissiam,
But fall, by murderou's hands untimely ssain,
And lie unburied on the naked plain !
This vow, ye gods, Eliza pours in death,
With her last blood, and her‘last gasping breath ἔ
Oh ! ›—in the filent grave wheh Dido lies,
Ris'e in thy rage, thou, great avenger, rise ‚¹
Against curs’d Troy, go mighty son of Tyre,
G0, in the pomp of famine, sword‚ and fite !
And you, my Tyrians, with immortal hate,
In future times, pursue the Dardan state:
No peace, no commerce with the race be made.
Pay this last duty to your princess' {hade-
Fight, when your pow’r supplies so just a rago5
Fight now, fight still,- in every distan't age3
