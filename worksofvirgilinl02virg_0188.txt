Tum pavidae tetff'tis matres ingentibus errant,
Amplexaeque tenent postes, atque oscula «figunt. 490

Inmisii Danai, ct late loca milite conplent. 495

Fertur in arva furens cumulo, camposque per omnis
Cum stabulis armenta trahit. vidi ipse furentem·

Sanguine foedantem, quos ipse sacraverat, ignis.
Qinguaginta illi thalami, spes tanta nepotum,
Barbarico postes auro spoliisque superbi

664. And furious Pyrrhus] The charafi'ter of this son of
Achilles is all along supported with great spirit. There is a
fine passage in the eleventh book of the Odyffey, which from
the relation it bears to this second book of the AEneicl Ι shall
quote at length. Achilles enquires of Ulyffes the behaviour
, of his son, since he himself died : and Ulyss‘es‚ to give him the
highest idea of Pyrrhus his courage, answers him in the fot-
lowing lines ε

When Ilion in the horse receiv'd her doom,

And unseen armies ambush’d in its womb,
Greece gave her latent warriors to my care,
'Twas mine on Troy to pour th’ imprison'd war:
Then when the boldest bosom Vbeat for sear,
&leem the stern eyes of heroes drop'd a tear3
Fierce in his look his ardent valour glow’d ‚
Flush'd in his check or sally'd in his blood3
Indignant in the dark recess he stands,

Pants for the battle, and the war demands;

His voice breath'd death; and with a martial air,
He grasp'd his sword, and {hook his glittering spear.

Pope has animated and added fire to the original lines.
