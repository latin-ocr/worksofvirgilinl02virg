80 Ρ. memx MARONIS Aemus. Lib. 1.

Tum victu revocant vires : fusique per herbam

Inplentur veterIS bacchi pinguisque ferinae. 215
Postquam exemta fames epulis, mensaeque remores,
Amissos longo socios sermone requirunt ;

Spemque metumque inter dubii : seu vivere credant,

Sive extrema pati, nec jam exaudire vocatos.

Praecipue pius Aeneas, nunc acris Oronti, 220
Nunc Amyci casum gemit, et crudelia secum

Fata Lyci, fortemque Gyan, fortemque Cloanthum.

Et jam finis erat : cum Juppiter aethere summo
Despiciens mare velivolum terrasque jacentis,

Litoraque, et latos populos, lic vertice caeli 225
Constitit, et Libyae defixit lumina regnis.

Atque illum talis jactantem pectore curas

Tristior, et lacrimis oculos suffusa nitentis,

Adloquitur Venus : O qui res hominumque deorumque
Aeternis regis imperiis, et fulmine terres, 230

not fill’d his poem with so many heroes as Homer hath done.

Ajax, Diomed, Idomeneus, διε. are all {hining characters, and

ar'e all diverfified and distinguilhed from one another. WVhereas

the faithful Achates, the brave Gyas, and the brave Cloan-

thus [fortemque Gyanfortemque Cloanthum] the same over and

over again, are of no material use in the poem, and serve only

to fill now and then the gap of a verse or two. Mr. Voltaire²s .
answer to this censure is as follows :

“ I am apt' to think, says he, that such an objeffion turns a
great deal to the advantage of the AEneid: Virgil sung the
afiiom of AEneas‚ and Homer the idleneſs of Achilles. The
Greek poet lay under the neceflity of supplying the absence of
his first hero, with some other warriors; but what wasjudicious
in Homer, would have been preposterous in virgil z he knew
too much of his art, to drown his principa] charafter in the
crowd of many other heroes, indifferent to the main action. ‘

'‘ Thus he found the way to center our concern in AEneas ς
he interests us for him by never lofing fight of him, while
Homer presenting us with the shifting scene of so many ihining
charaetem interests us for none.'’ Addison's opinion on this
subject is likewise worthy the attention of the reade53 and
perhaps more just than the reasening of Voltaire. ¹
