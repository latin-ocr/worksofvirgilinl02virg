Book 3. Tm: AExmn oF VIRGIL.

Led by our care, shall thy descendants riso,
The world's majestic mormrchs, to the skics.
Then build thy city for imperial sway,
And boldly take the long laborious way.
Forsake this region3 for the Delian pow'r
Affign’d not for thy seat the Gnoflian ihore.
Once by Oenotrians till’d‚ there lies a place,
'Twas call’d Hesperia by the Grecian 1‘ace3
For martial deeds and fruits renown'd by farne 3
But since, Italia, from the leader’s name.
These are the native realms the fates affign 3
Hence rose the fathers of the Trojan line 5
The great Iasius, sprung from heaven above,
And ancient Dardanus, deriv’d from Jove.
Rise then, in haste these joyful tidings bear,
These truths unquestion'd to thy father's ear.
Begone—-the fair Ausoniam realms exploro,
FQ-Jffl'e himself denies the Cs0t²²¹¹3h0sjss
Struck with the voice divine, and awefui sight,
No common dream, or vision of the night;
I saw the wreaths‚ their feature33 and a stream
Of trickling sweat ran down from every limb.
I started from my bed, and rais’d on high
My hands and voice in rapturo to the sky.
Then (to our gods the due oblations paid)
The scene divine before my fire I laid.
He owns his error of each ancient place,
Our two great founders, and the double sace,
hdy son, he cry'd, whom adverse fares employ,
Oh ! exercis’d in all the woes of Troy!
Now I refle&, Caffandra’s word divine
Affign’d these regions to the Dardan linc.
But who surmis’d, the sons of Troy should come
To fair Hesperia from their distant home?
Or who gave credit to Caffindra’s strain,
Doom'd by the fatos* to prophcsy in vain ?
