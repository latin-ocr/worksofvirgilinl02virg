Now the fond princess leads her hero on,
Shows him her Tyrian wealth, and growing town ; 1 ¹5
Displays her pompous tow’rs that proudly nse,
And hopes to tempt him with the glorious prize 3
Now as {he tries to tell her raging flame,
Stops ffiort‚—and faulters, check'd by conscious {hasne :
Now, at the close of evening‚ calls her guest, 120
To share the banquet, and renew the feast :
She fondly begs him to repeat once more
The Trojan story that she heard before ς
Then to distraffifion charm'd‚ in raptore hung
On every word, and dy'd upon his tongue. 12 5
But when the setting stars to rest invite,
And fading Cynthia veils her beamy light 3
When all the guests retire to soft repose;
Left in the hall, ihe fighs‚ and vents her woes,
Lies on his conch, bedews it with her tears‚ 130
In fancy sees her absent prince‚ and hears
His charming voice still founding in her ears. }
Fir’d with the glori0us hero’s graceful look,
The young Ascanius on her lap {he took,

With trifling play her furious pains beguil’d ; ¹35
In vain !——the father eharms her in the child.

No more the tow’rs‚ unfmish’d, rise in air ε

The youth, undisciplin'd‚ no rnore prepare }
Ports for the fleet, or bulwarks for the war 3

The works and battlements neglee'ced lie, 140
And the proud stru&ures cease to brave the sszy.

The fair thus rages with the mighty pain,
That fir’d her foul ; and honour pleads in vain.
