Book 2. THE AENEm oF Vmcrt. ¹73

A secret portico contriv'd behind, 605
Great Heecor’s manfion to the palaea join’d‚

By which his hapless princess oft would bring

Her royal infant to the good old king.

This way the topmost battlements I gain,
Whencethe tir’d Trojans threw their darts in vain. 610

Rais’d on a lofty point, a turret rears

κ Her stately head unrival’d to the stars ς

From hence we wont all Ilion to survey,

The fields, the camp, the fleets, and rolling sea.

With steel the yielding timbers we affail’d, 615
'W'here loose the huge disjointed struaeture fail’d3

Then‚ tugg'd convulfive from the ihatter'd walls,

We push the pile: the pond‘rous ruin falls

Tumbling in many a xa'hirl, with thund'rIng found,
Down headlong on the foes, and smokes along the ground.
But crowds on crowds the bury'd troops supply; 621
And in a storm the beams and rocky fragments fly.

618. PVe pufh the pile.] This is a fine instance of the trans-
lator's making the sound of the verses an echo to the sense.
The· pause is likewise very judiciem, and closely imitates the
ongmal’ ⁷ —convellimus altis

Sedibus inpulimusque.——

I shall add a passage in Leonidas, where the Greeks gather to·
gether stones of the greatest bulk and bodies of vast trees, and
push them down from Mount OEta upon the heads of the Per-

fians who fought beneath.

Downward finks

The nodding pile, stupendous heap of death!
Trees roll'd on trees with mingled rock descend
Unintermitted ruin. Loud resound

The hollow trunks against the mountain's fide,
Swift bounds each craggy mass.—

- The poet then adds a circumstance, which is entirelyhew and
his own, and strongly conceived.

 

 

The foes beneath

Look up aghast‚ with horror shrink, and die.
Leonidas, Book v. 736.
