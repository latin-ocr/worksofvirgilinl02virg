Book 3. THE AEmzm OF Vmom. ἡ ²39

Compos'd the soul ; and, wid> a dismal kun-³11,
Took thrice the melancholy {ost farewell.
Soon as our fleet could trust the smiling sea, 90
“ And the soft breeze had smooth'd the watry way3
Call'd by the whisp'ring gades, we rig the snips,
Crowd round the shores, and launch into the deep&
Swift from the port our' eager course we pjy, .
And lands and towns roll backward as we fly. 95
By Doris lov’d, and Ocean's azure god,
Lies a fair isse amid th' AEgean flood3 ψ
Which Phoebus fix'd3 for once she wander'd round
The shores, and floated on the vast profound.
But now unmov'd‚ the peopled region braves 100
The roaring whirlwinds, and the furious wave84
Safe in her open ports the sacred isse
Receiv'd υς, barrass'd with the naval toil.
Our rev'rence due to Phoebus’ town we pay,
And holy Anius meets us on the way 3 105
Anius, whose brows the wreaths and laurels grace,
Priest of the god, and sovereign of the place.
Well-pleasfd to see our train the {horeascend‚
He ssew to meet my fire, his ancient friend ;
In hospipable guise our hands he prst, 110
Then to'the palace led cacjn honour’ci gut‘st·
To Phoebus’ aged temple I repair,
And suppliant to the god prefer my pray’r ς
To wand'ring wretches, who in exile roam,
Grant, O Thymbraean god, a settled home 3 115
Oh ,ἶ grant thy supplianfw, their lon-g labe-252 past,
A race to flourish, and a toz. :2 to last 3
