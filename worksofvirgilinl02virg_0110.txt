Instant ardentes Tyrii : pars ducere muros,

Molirique arcem, et manibus subvolvere saxa:

Pars optare locum tecto, et concludere sulco. 425
Jura, magistratusque legunt, sanctumque senatum.

Hic portus alii effodiunt: hic alta theatris

Fundamenta locant alii 3 inmanisque columnas

But Scaliger was unlucky in his choice of this particular com·
parison. There is a very line one in the fixth AEneid, ver. 707.
that better agrees with Homer's: and nothing is more evi-
dent, than that the defign of these two is very different. H0-
