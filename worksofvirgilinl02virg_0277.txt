Book 3. THE AEnmn or V1Ro11.. 265

Since, mighty chief, the deities, your guides, 500
With prosperous omens wast you o'er the tides,
Such is the doom of fate, the will of Jove,
The firm decree of him who reigns above ε
Hear me, of many things, explain a few,
Your future course with safety to pursue ς 505
And, all these foreign floods and countries past,
To reach the wissx'd Ausonian port at last.
μ The rest the fates from Helenus conceal,
And heav'n’s dread queen forbids me to reveal.
First then, that Italy, that promis’d land, 510
Tho' thy fond hopes already grasp the strand,
(Tho’ now stxe seems so near,) a mighty tide,
And long, long regions from your reach divide.
Sicilian seas must bend your plunging oar33
Your fleet must coast the fair Ausonian shores, 515
And reach the dreadful isse, the dire abode
Where Circe reigns 3 and stem the Stygian flood,
Before your fated city ihall ascend.
Hear then, and these auspicious signs attend ε
ἶᾸῙὴεη, lost in contemplation deep, you find 520
A large white mother of the bristly kind,
With her white brood of thirty young, who drain
Her swelling dugs, where Tyber bathes the plain :
There, there, thy town shall rise, my godlike friend,
And all thy labours find their destin'd end. 525
Fear then Celaeno's direful threats no more,
That your fierce hunger ihall your boards devour.
Apollo, when invok‘d, will teach the way,
And fate the mystic riddle shall display.
But these next borders of th’ Italian shores, 530
On whose rough rocky fides our ocean roars, ’
Avoid with caution, for the Grecian train
Poffess those realms that stretch along the main.
Here, the fierce Locrians hold their dreadful scat;
There, brave Idomeneus, expell'd from Crete, 535
