282 P. VIRGILH MARONIS Aemus. Lib. 3·.

Interdum scopulos avolsaque viscera montis 575
Erigit erudiaris, liquefactaque saxa sub auras

Cum gemitu glomerat, fundoque exaestuat'imo.

Fama est, Enceladi semiustum fulmine corpus

Urgeri mole hac, ingentemque insuper Aetnam
Inpositam, ruptis flammam exspirare caminis 3 580
Et, fessum quoties mutat latus, intremere omnem
Murmure Trinacriam, et caelum subtexere fumo.
Noctem illam teeti silvis inmania monstra

Perferimus : nee, quae sonitum det caussa, videmus:
Nam neque erant astrorum ignes, nec lucidus aethra 58 5
Siderea polus 3 obscuro sed nubila caelo ε

Et lunam in nimbo nox intempesta tenebat.

Postera jamque dies primo surgebat Eoo,

Humentemque Aurora polo dimoverat umbram ε

says, happen’d in the third year of the 88th Olymp. the for<
mer about fifty years before, that is, in the last year of the
76th‚ or the first year of the 77th Olymp. Of the date of the
first eruption he makes no mention. Probably no more was
known in his time about it, than that it was the first, and the
oniy one, besides the two above-mentioned, that had hap-
pened from the time of the Greeks first settling in Sicily, as
he expressly tells us. This ode was composed in the 78th
Olymp. about four or five years after the second eruption
mentioned by Thucydides. The city of AEtna founded on
the ruins ef Cat-ana, was built by Hiero in the 76th Olymp.
and stood in' the neighbourhood of Mount AEtna, from which
it derived its name. From all these confiderations it appears,
with how much proprie-'ty Pindar has here introduced a de-
scription of the tiery eruptions of that burning mountain 3 one
of which having happened so lately as four or five years be-
fore the writing this ode, could not but be very freih in the Α
memorics of the inhabitants of the city of AEtna, whose territo-
ries, and even the [own itiels, were in great danger of being
laid waste and destroyed by the torrents of fire, which iffued
from the neighbouring mountain, or by the earthquakes‚ that
usually attendcd thole eruptions. With the same propriety
therefore he closes his description, with a prayer to Jupiter,
who had a temple on Mount AEtna, imploring his favour and
protection. The other beauties of this fine passage are so vi-
fible and striking, that Ι need not point thern out to thejudi- -
cious reader. Ι shall only observe, that I’indar is the first poet,

that has given us a description ofthese fiery eruptions'ofpgount ἱ
