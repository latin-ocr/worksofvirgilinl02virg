232 Ρ. V1R01L11 MARoms ΑΕΝΕιε, Lib. 3,

Incerti quo fata ferant, ubi fistcre detur3
Contrahimusque viros. vix prima inceperat aestas;

Et pater Auchis-:s dare fatis velajubebat : ’
Litora cum patriae lacrimans portusque relinquo, ιο
Et campos ubi Troja suit. feror exul in altum

Cum sociis, gnatoque, Penatibu8‚ et magnis dis.

Terra procul vastis colitur Mavortia campis,

(Therses arant) acri quondam regnata Lycurgo;
Hospitium antiquum Trojae, sociique Penates, ¹5 ,
” Dum fortuna fuit. feror hue, et litore curvo

Moenia prima loeo, satis ingressus iniquis:

Aeneadasque meo nomen de nomine fingo.

Sacra Dionaeae matri, divisque ferebam

Auspicibus coeptorum operum : superoque nitentem 20
Caelicolum regi mactabam in litore taurum.

Forte fuit juxta tumulus, quo cornea summo

Virgulta, et denfis hastilibus horrida myrtus.

Acceffi, viridemque ab humo convellere filvam

conatus, ramis tegerem ut frondentibus aras : 25
Horrendum‚ ct die'tu video mirabile monstrum.

Nam, quae prima solo ruptis radicibus arbos

34. W'hen lo .' a hor-rid prodigy] If there be any instance
(says ΜΓ. Addison) in the AEnmd, liable to exception, it is in
the beginning of the third book, where AEneas is represented
as tearing up the myrtle that dropped blood. This circum-
stance seems to have the marvellous without the probable‚ be·
cause it is represented as proceeding from natural causes, with-
out the interpofition of any god, or rather supernatural power,
capable of producing it. Dr. Wnrburton’s answer to thisxob-
jettion is senfible: When this amiable writer, says he, made
'this remark, he appears not t0. have recolleeted what AEneas
says on the Occaslon ι

 

Iffivnphas venerabar agrzstls,
‘Gradivomque patrem, Geticis qui praestdet arvis,
R ite secundarent visus, omenque levarent.

Now these kind of omens, for there were two sorts, were al-
ways supposed to be produced by the intervention of a super-
natural power3 as was the raining of blood so frequently related
by the Roman annalists. And the poet was certainly within
the bounds ofthe probable, while he told no more than what'

the graues} historians recorded in every page of their annBaIS.
